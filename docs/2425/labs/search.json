If you are unsure what to do, check the collapsible hint provided (note that these are only present for some questions).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a hint.\n\n\n\nNotes are displayed in blue boxes, with the title ‘Note’. These are occasionally used to draw your attention to a specific point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a note.\n\n\nExample write-ups and/or interpretations are shown with a red right border. These are helpful to check your interpretation against, and a useful guide to use in future when interpreting and/or writing up results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example write-up / interpretation block.\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions\nSolutions are made available immediately below each exercise. To view solutions, click the drop down ‘Solution’ button.\nImportant  Before checking the solution you should attempt the question. You should also avoid copying and pasting code from the solutions. If you do check solutions right away and simply copy the answer, you will struggle to learn from the exercises.\nInstead, you should:\n\nTry to figure out the answer yourself or with your peers (and/or ask for help from a staff member if needed)\nType the code out yourself (and annotate your R code chunks so you know what your code is doing & why - future you will thank you for this).\n\n\n\n\nAsking Questions\n\nDuring labs, if you have a question, please ask one of the tutors for support.\nOutside of labs, we encourage you to use the various support options, details of which can be found on the Course Learn Page."

    "text": "Tips on Googling Statistics and R\nSearching online for help with statistics and R can be both a help and a hindrance. If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into Google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"
