To understand the strength of association between the two variables, the correlation coefficient was estimated. To investigate whether the number of weekly social interactions influences wellbeing (WEMWBS) scores, the following simple linear regression model was used:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions}\n\\] From Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see that both wellbeing \\((M = 36.3, SD = 5.39)\\) and social interactions \\((M = 12.06, SD = 4.02)\\) followed unimodal distributions. There was a weak, positive, linear association between WEMWBS scores and the weekly number of social interactions for the participants in the sample \\((r = .24)\\).\nFull regression results are displayed in Table 3. There was a significant association between wellbeing scores and social interactions \\((\\beta = 0.32, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001)\\). The estimated wellbeing score with no social interactions per week was 32.41. Each additional social interaction was associated with a 0.32 point increase in wellbeing scores."

    "text": "Model Fitting & Interpretation\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nRecall the model specified in Q1, and:\n\nState the parameters of the model. How do we denote parameter estimates?\n\nFit the linear model in using lm(), assigning the output to an object called mdl1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did for simple linear regression, we can fit our multiple regression model using the lm() function. For a recap, see the statistical models flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA model for the association between \\(x_1\\) = weekly numbers of social interactions, \\(x_2\\) = weekly outdoor time, and \\(y\\) = scores on the WEMWBS can be given by: \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon \\\\ \\quad \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nIn the model specified above,\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x_2\\) represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of \\(y\\) at each combination of values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.\n\nThe parameters of our model are:\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) (The intercept);\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_1\\));\n\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_2\\));\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) (The standard deviation of the errors).\n\nWhen we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a fitted model (recall that the h\\(\\hat{\\textrm{a}}\\)ts are used to distinguish our estimates from the true unknown parameters):\n\\[\n\\widehat{Wellbeing} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\hat \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time\n\\] And we have residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon = y - \\hat y\\) which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.\nFitting the model in R:\n\nmdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual\nNote that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a line in 2 dimensions: the systematic part \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) defined a line for \\(\\mu_y\\) across the possible values of \\(x\\), with \\(\\epsilon\\) as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model.\nIn this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a regression surface (see Figure 3). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regression surface for wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, from two different angles\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables! We can only concieve of 3 spatial dimensions. One could imagine this surface changing over time, which would bring in a 4th dimension, but beyond that, it’s not worth trying!\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nUsing any of:\n\nmdl1\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\nWrite out the estimated parameter values of:\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_0\\), the estimated average wellbeing score associated with zero hours of outdoor time and zero social interactions per week.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_1\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with an additional social interaction per week (an increase of one), holding weekly outdoor time constant.\n\n\n\\(\\hat \\beta_2\\), the estimated increase in average wellbeing score associated with one hour increase in weekly outdoor time, holding the number of social interactions constant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo interpret and extract information, see the simple & multiple regression models - extracing information flashcards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\ncoef(mdl1)\ncoefficients(mdl1)\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\n\n\nmdl1$coefficients\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoef(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\n\ncoefficients(mdl1)\n\n (Intercept)   social_int outdoor_time \n  28.6201808    0.3348821    0.1990943 \n\n\n\n\nLook under the “Estimate” column:\n\nsummary(mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

For a recap, see the statistical models flashcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nA model for the association between \\(x_1\\) = weekly numbers of social interactions, \\(x_2\\) = weekly outdoor time, and \\(y\\) = scores on the WEMWBS can be given by: \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon \\\\ \\quad \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nIn the model specified above,\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x_2\\) represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of \\(y\\) at each combination of values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.\n\nThe parameters of our model are:\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) (The intercept);\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_1\\));\n\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_2\\));\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) (The standard deviation of the errors).\n\nWhen we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a fitted model (recall that the h\\(\\hat{\\textrm{a}}\\)ts are used to distinguish our estimates from the true unknown parameters):\n\\[\n\\widehat{Wellbeing} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\hat \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time\n\\] And we have residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon = y - \\hat y\\) which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.\nFitting the model in R:\n\nmdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual\nNote that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a line in 2 dimensions: the systematic part \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) defined a line for \\(\\mu_y\\) across the possible values of \\(x\\), with \\(\\epsilon\\) as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model.\nIn this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a regression surface (see Figure 3). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regression surface for wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, from two different angles\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables!

    "text": "Numeric Exploration\nNumeric exploration of data involves examining key statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation via descriptives tables; and assessing the associations among variables through correlation coefficients. Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data.\nDescriptives\n\n Descriptives Tables\n\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as tidyverse and psych.\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the kable() function from the package kableExtra.\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via caption = \"insert caption here\", align values within columns e.g., center aligned via align = \"??\"), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via digits = ??).\nWe can also add in the function kable_styling(). This is really helpful for customsing your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!).\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp\n\n\n\n\n Descriptives Tables - Examples\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse way\nThe psych way\n\n\n\nWe can use the summarise() function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via mean(), standard deviation (via sd()), minimum value (via min()), maximum value (via max()), standard error (via se()), and skewness (via skew()).\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\nM_Length\nSD_Length\n\n\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe describe() function will produce a table of descriptive statistics. If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use select() after calling describe() e.g., describe() %&gt;% select(mean, sd).\nFor example:\n\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\ndescribe(iris$Sepal.Length) %&gt;%\n    select(mean, sd) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\nSepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\n\n\nmean\nsd\n\n\nX1\n5.84\n0.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\n\n Correlation Coefficient\n\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a standardised number which quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. In a population it is denoted by \\(\\rho\\), and in a sample it is denoted by \\(r\\).\nValues of \\(r\\) fall between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). How to interpret:\n\nSize: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer \\(r\\) is to \\(+/- 1\\)) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to \\(0\\) a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n\nWeak = \\(.1 &lt; |r| &lt; .3\\)\n\nModerate = \\(.3 &lt; |r| &lt; .5\\)\n\nStrong = \\(|r| &gt; .5\\)\n\n\n\nDirection: The sign of \\(r\\) says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n\nPositive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\nNegative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation Matrix\n\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - \\(r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}\\) - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).\n\nIn R\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the cor() function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables must be numeric.\n\nLet’s check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\nstr(iris)\n\n'data.frame':   150 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...\n $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...\n $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...\n $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...\n $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels \"setosa\",\"versicolor\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n\nWe can see that the variable Species in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to subset, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside [], or using select(). In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\nIf you had NA values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these NAs using na.rm = TRUE inside the cor() function.\n\n\nIndex dataframe ([])\nVariable selection (select())\n\n\n\n\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %&gt;% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  cor() %&gt;%\n  round(digits = 2)\n\n             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width\nSepal.Length         1.00       -0.12         0.87        0.82\nSepal.Width         -0.12        1.00        -0.43       -0.37\nPetal.Length         0.87       -0.43         1.00        0.96\nPetal.Width          0.82       -0.37         0.96        1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\n\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the population parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., \\(\\rho\\)).\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho = 0\\). There is no linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the population.\n\n\n\\(H_1: \\rho \\neq 0\\) There is a linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nIf we instead conduct a one-tailed test, then we are testing either…\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho \\leq 0\\) There is a negative or no linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(H_1: \\rho &gt; 0\\) There is a positive linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nOR\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\rho \\geq 0\\) There is a positive or no linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\n\n\\(H_1: \\rho &lt; 0\\) There is a negative linear association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\nTest Statistic\nThe test statistic for this test is the \\(t\\) statistic, the formula for which depends on both the observed correlation (\\(r\\)) and the sample size (\\(n\\)):\n\\[t = r \\sqrt{\\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}\\]\np-value\nWe calculate the \\(p\\)-value for our \\(t\\)-statistic as the long-run probability of a \\(t\\)-statistic with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom being less than, greater than, or more extreme in either direction (depending on the direction of our alternative hypothesis) than our observed \\(t\\)-statistic.\nAssumptions\nFor a test of Pearson’s correlation coefficient \\(r\\), we need to make sure a few conditions are met:\n\nBoth variables are quantitative (i.e., numeric)\nBoth variables are drawn from normally distributed populations\nThe association between the two variables is linear\n\n\n\n\n\n Correlation - Hypothesis Testing in R\n\n\n\nIn R\nWe can test the significance of the correlation coefficient really easily with the function cor.test():\n\ncor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\n\n\n    Pearson's product-moment correlation\n\ndata:  iris$Sepal.Length and iris$Petal.Length\nt = 21.646, df = 148, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.8270363 0.9055080\nsample estimates:\n      cor \n0.8717538 \n\n\nNote, by default, cor.test() will include only observations that have no missing data on either variable.\nWe can specify whether we want to conduct a one- or two-tailed test by adding the argument alternative = and specifying alternative = \"less\", alternative = \"greater\", or alternative = \"two.sided\" (the latter being the default).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Interpretation\nThere was a strong positive association between sepal length and petal length \\((r = .87, t(148) = 21.65, p &lt; .001)\\). These results suggested that a greater sepal length was positively associated with a greater petal length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor a detailed recap of all things correlation (including further details and examples), revisit the Correlation lecture from DAPR1."

    "text": "Visual Exploration\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n How to Visualise Data\n\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use ggplot() from the tidyverse package. Note the key components of the ggplot() code:\n\n\ndata = where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n\naes = where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the \\(x\\)-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n\n+ geom_... = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in aes().\n\nlabs() = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-axis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., bins =, alpha =, fill =, linewidth =. linetype =, size = etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using ? - e.g., ?fill\nIf you’d like to read more about ggplot(), there is a handy cheatsheet.\n\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:\n\nUse to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels\n\nThe patchwork package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - | arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and / arranges the plots on top of one another\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nDensity\n\n\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width.\nBasic:\n\nx-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\ny-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n\nWhat are bins?: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Bins:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify bins = to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can specify binwidth = to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutline columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify color = to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill columns with color:\nWithin geom_histogram(), we can specify fill = to fill the columns with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable.\nBasic:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilled:\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying fill = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine Type & Width:\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying linetype = and linewidth = within geom_density():\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\n\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within aes(), to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis.\n\nScatterplot\n\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values.\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a cloud of scattered points.\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud\n\nBasic:\nWe need to specify + geom_point() to get a scatterplot:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill points with color:\nWithin geom_point(), we can specify fill = to fill the points with a color:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange size and opacity:\nWe can change the size (using size =) and the opacity (using alpha =) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line of best fit:\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument + geom_smooth(). Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use method = \"lm\". We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying se = TRUE / FALSE.\n\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")"

To do so, there are lots of different packages available (see Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp).\nOne of the most convenient ways to present results from regression models is to use the tab_model() function from sjPlot\n\n Creating tables via tab_model\n\n\nWithin tab_model(), there are lots of different ways that you can customise your table. The most common arguments that you should use are dv.labels, pred.labels, and title.\nYou can rename your DV and IV labels by specifying dv.labels and pred.labels. To do so, specify your variable name on the left, and what you would like this to be named in the table on the right. For title, you can simply specify in ““’s what you want your title to be e.g., title = \"This is my title\".\nHere’s an example if I had fitted a model with the following information:\n\nModel name = mdl_test\n\nModel DV = cognitive_score\n\nModel IVs = SES and age\n\n\n\nmdl_test &lt;- lm(cognitive_score ~ SES + age, data = data_name)\n\nI want to change the names of SES and age to be socio-economic status and age - in years respectively.

The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful.
