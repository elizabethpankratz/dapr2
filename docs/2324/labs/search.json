To do so, you need to complete four steps:\n\nCreate a sequence of one hundred side lengths (x) going from 0 to 3 metres.\nCompute the corresponding perimeters (y).\nPlot the side and perimeter data as points on a graph.\nVisualise the functional relationship between side and perimeter of squares. To do so, use the function geom_line() to connect the computed points with lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a sequence of numbers, we can use the function seq(). We need to include within the seq() argument our from and to values (i.e., the lowest and highest values in the sequence), as well as length.out to specify the length of the sequence (i.e., how many 0-3’s do we want).\nIf you would like to change the colour of the line (step 4), you can specify geom_line(colour = \"insert_colour\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nSteps 1 & 2 - create the side and perimeter data:\n\nsquares_grid &lt;- tibble(\n  side = seq(0, 3, length.out = 100),\n  perimeter = 4 * side)\n\nStep 3 - plot the individual points:\n\nggplot(data = squares_grid, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)', title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4 - visualise the functional relationship by connecting the individual points with a line:\n\nggplot(data = squares_grid, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = 'blue') +\n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)', title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThe function \\(y = 4 \\ x\\) that you plotted above is an example of a function representing a mathematical model.\nWe typically validate a model using experimental data. However, we all know how squares work and that two squares with the same side will have the same perimeter (more on this later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nThe Scottish National Gallery kindly provided us with measurements of side and perimeter (in metres) for a sample of 10 square paintings.\nThe data are provided below:\n\nsng &lt;- tibble(\n  side = c(1.3, 0.75, 2, 0.5, 0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 0.85, 1.1, 0.2),\n  perimeter = c(5.2, 3.0, 8.0, 2.0, 1.2, 4.4, 9.2, 3.4, 4.4, 0.8)\n)\n\nPlot the mathematical model of the relationship between side and perimeter for squares, and superimpose on top the experimental data from the Scottish National Gallery.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nsng &lt;- tibble(\n  side = c(1.3, 0.75, 2, 0.5, 0.3, 1.1, 2.3, 0.85, 1.1, 0.2),\n  perimeter = c(5.2, 3.0, 8.0, 2.0, 1.2, 4.4, 9.2, 3.4, 4.4, 0.8)\n)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data = squares_grid, aes(x = side, y = perimeter), colour = 'blue') + # add blue line\n  geom_point(data = sng, aes(x = side, y = perimeter), colour = 'black',  # add black points\n             alpha = 0.5, size = 3) + # make the points 0.5 transparency, size 3\n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The exact relationship between side and perimeter of squares\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows perfect agreement between the observed data and the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nUse the mathematical model to predict the perimeter of a painting with a side of 1.5 metres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to always include the measurement units when reporting/writing-up results!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe do not have a painting with a side of 1.5 metres within the random sample of paintings from the Scottish National Gallery. However, we can predict the perimeter of an unobserved squared painting having a 1.5 metre side using the mathematical model.\nYou can obtain this prediction using either a visual approach or an algebraic one.\n\nVisual ApproachAlgebraic Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we can directly read a predicted value from the graph of the functional relationship.\nConsider the plot created in the previous question. First, we need to check where x = 1.5. Then, we draw a vertical dashed line until it meets the blue line. The y value corresponding to x = 1.5 can be read off the y-axis.\nHowever, in this case it is not that easy to read it from the drawing…\n\n\nYou can substitute the x value in the formula and calculate the corresponding y value. \\[\ny = 4 * x = 4 * 1.5 = 6\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted perimeter of squared paintings having a 1.5m side is 6m."

    "text": "Study Overview\n\nResearch Question\nHow does handspan vary as a function of height?\n\nConsider now the association between height (in inches) and handspan (in cm). Utts and Heckard (2015) provided data for a sample of 167 students which reported their height and handspan as part of a class survey.\nUsing the handheight data you already loaded at the start of the lab, your task is to investigate how handspan varies as a function of height for the students in the sample.\n\n Handheight codebook.\n\n\nDescription\nThe data set records the height and handspan reported by a random sample of 167 students as part of a class survey.\nThe variables are:\n\nheight, measured in inches\nhandspan, measured in centimetres\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\nheight\nhandspan\n\n\n\n\n68\n21.5\n\n\n71\n23.5\n\n\n73\n22.5\n\n\n64\n18.0\n\n\n68\n23.5\n\n\n59\n20.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nUsing a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables, comment on any main differences you notice with the association between side and perimeter of squares. Note if you detected outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nplt &lt;- ggplot(handheight, aes(x = height, y = handspan)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(x = 'Height (in.)', y = 'Handspan (cm)')\n\nplt\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Simple Scatterplot\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add marginal boxplots for each variable using the package ggExtra.\n\nggMarginal(plt, type = 'boxplot')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The statistical relationship between height and handspan\n\n\n\n\nOutliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\nmarginally along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\njointly: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud.\n\nThe boxplots in Figure 4 do not highlight any outliers in the marginal distributions of height and handspan. Furthermore, from the scatterplot we do not notice any extreme observations or points that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud.\nWe notice a moderate, positive linear association between height and handspan.\nRecall Figure 2, displaying the association between side and perimeters of squares. In the plot we notice two points on top of each other, reflecting the fact that two squares having the same side will always have the same perimeter. In fact, the data from the Scottish National Gallery include two squared paintings with a side of 1.1m, both having a measured perimeter of 4.4m.\nFigure 4, instead, displays the association between height and handspan of a sample of students. The first thing that grabs our attention is the fact that students having the same height do not necessarily have the same handspan. Rather, we clearly see a variety of handspan values for students all having a height of, for example, 70in. To be more precise, the seven students who are 70 in. tall all have differing handspans.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\nUsing the following command, superimpose on top of the scatterplot a best-fit line describing how handspan varies as a function of height. For the moment, the argument se = FALSE tells R to not display uncertainty bands.\n\ngeom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)\n\nComment on any differences between the lines representing the linear relationship between (a) the side and perimeter of square and (b) height and handspan.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nggplot(handheight, aes(x = height, y = handspan)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = 'Height (in.)', y = 'Handspan (cm)')\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The best-fit line\n\n\n\n\nThe line representing the relationship between side and perimeter of squares is able to predict the actual perimeter value from the measurement of the side of a square. This is possible because the relationship between side and perimeter is an exact one.\nThat is, any squares having the same side will have the same perimeter, and there will be no variation in those values.\nThe line that best fits the relationship between height and handspan (see Figure 5), instead, is only able to predict the average handspan for a given value of height.\nThis is because there will be a distribution of handspans at each value of height. The line will fit the trend/pattern in the values, but there will be individual-to-individual variability that we must accept around that average pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 10\n\n\nThe line of best-fit is given by:1\n\\[\n\\widehat{Handspan} = -3 + 0.35 \\cdot Height\n\\]\nEstimate (or predict) handspan of a student who is (a) 73in tall, and (b) 5in tall.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nThe predicted average handspan for students who are 73in tall is:  \\(-3 + (0.35 * 73) = 22.55\\)cm.  \nThe predicted average handspan for students who are 5in tall is:  \\(-3 + (0.35 * 5) = -1.25\\)cm.\n\nBut wait, handspan can not be negative… This does not make any sense! That’s right, we went too far off the range of the available data on heights, which were between 57in and 78in. We extrapolated. This is very dangerous…\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Randall Munroe, xkcd.com"

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nTo visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, density plots were used. To understand the strength of association between the two variables, the correlation coefficient was estimated. To investigate whether the number of weekly social interactions influences wellbeing (WEMWBS) scores, the following simple linear regression model was used:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Social Interactions}\n\\] From Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see that both wellbeing \\((M = 36.3, SD = 5.39)\\) and social interactions \\((M = 12.06, SD = 4.02)\\) followed unimodal distributions. There was a weak, positive, linear association between WEMWBS scores and the weekly number of social interactions for the participants in the sample \\((r = .24)\\).\nFull regression results are displayed in Table 3. There was a significant association between wellbeing scores and social interactions \\((\\beta = 0.32, SE = 0.09, p &lt; .001)\\). The estimated wellbeing score with no social interactions per week was 32.41. Each additional social interaction was associated with a 0.32 point increase in wellbeing scores."

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nDensity plots and boxplots will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing, social interactions, and outdoor time. To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the the correlation coefficients. To address the research question of whether there is an association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions, we are going to fit the following multiple linear regression model:\n\\[\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time + \\epsilon\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\).\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_2 = 0\\): There is no association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions\n\\(H_1: \\beta_2 \\neq 0\\): There is an association between wellbeing and time spent outdoors after taking into account the association between wellbeing and social interactions"

How do we denote parameter estimates?\n\nFit the linear model in using lm(), assigning the output to an object called mdl1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we did for simple linear regression, we can fit our multiple regression model using the lm() function. We can add as many explanatory (i.e., independent) variables as we like, separating them with a +.\n model name &lt;- lm(dependent variable ~ independent variable 1 + independent variable 2 + …, data = dataframe) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nA model for the association between \\(x_1\\) = weekly numbers of social interactions, \\(x_2\\) = weekly outdoor time, and \\(y\\) = scores on the WEMWBS can be given by: \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon \\\\ \\quad \\\\\n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\text{ independently}\n\\]\nIn the model specified above,\n\n\n\\(\\mu_{y|x_1, x_2} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x_2\\) represents the systematic part of the model giving the mean of \\(y\\) at each combination of values of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\);\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) represents the error (deviation) from that mean, and the errors are independent from one another.\n\nThe parameters of our model are:\n\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) (The intercept);\n\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_1\\));\n\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (The slope across values of \\(x_2\\));\n\n\n\\(\\sigma\\) (The standard deviation of the errors).\n\nWhen we estimate these parameters from the available data, we have a fitted model (recall that the h\\(\\hat{\\textrm{a}}\\)ts are used to distinguish our estimates from the true unknown parameters):\n\\[\n\\widehat{Wellbeing} = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\hat \\beta_2 \\cdot Outdoor~Time\n\\] And we have residuals \\(\\hat \\epsilon = y - \\hat y\\) which are the deviations from the observed values and our model-predicted responses.\nFitting the model in R:\n\nmdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = mwdata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual\nNote that for simple linear regression we talked about our model as a line in 2 dimensions: the systematic part \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\) defined a line for \\(\\mu_y\\) across the possible values of \\(x\\), with \\(\\epsilon\\) as the random deviations from that line. But in multiple regression we have more than two variables making up our model.\nIn this particular case of three variables (one outcome + two explanatory), we can think of our model as a regression surface (see Figure 3). The systematic part of our model defines the surface across a range of possible values of both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Deviations from the surface are determined by the random error component, \\(\\hat \\epsilon\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Regression surface for wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, from two different angles\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about trying to figure out how to visualise it if we had any more explanatory variables!

This might help get you started:\n\n geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope) \n\nYou may also want to plot these side by side to more easily compare, so consider using | from patchwork.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nFirst extract the values required for both non-standardized and standardized models:\n\n#non-standardized (from 'mdl')\nbetas &lt;- coef(mdl)\nintercept &lt;- betas[1]\nslope &lt;- betas[2]\n\n#standardized (from 'mdl_z')\nbetas_z &lt;- coef(mdl_z)\nintercept_z &lt;- betas_z[1]\nslope_z &lt;- betas_z[2]\n\nWe can plot the models as follows:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept, slope = slope, color = 'blue') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = z_social_int, y = z_wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(intercept = intercept_z, slope = slope_z, color = 'red') + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions \\n(Number per Week; Z-Scored)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS) Scores; Z-Scored\")\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarities\n\nThe data points are distributed in the same pattern\n\nThe slope of the line follows the same gradient\n\nDifferences\n\nThe x- and y-axis scales are different for each plot. This is because:\n\nThe unstandardized is in the original units where we interpret the slope as the change in \\(y\\) units for a unit change in \\(x\\)\n\nThe standardized is in SD units where we interpret the slope as the SD change in \\(y\\) for 1 SD change in \\(x\\)"

All variables (wellbeing, social interactions, and outdoor time) were \\(z\\)-scored. As presented in Table 1, outdoor time was significantly associated with wellbeing scores \\((\\beta = 0.26, SE = 0.07, p &lt; .001)\\) after controlling for the number of weekly social interactions. Results suggested that, holding constant social interactions, for every standard deviation increase in outdoor time, wellbeing scores increased on average by 0.26 standard deviations. Therefore, we should reject the null hypothesis since \\(p &lt; .05\\)."

The simulated data are based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the following paper:\nRozgonjuk, D., Sindermann, C., Elhai, J. D., & Montag, C. (2021). Individual differences in Fear of Missing Out (FoMO): Age, gender, and the Big Five personality trait domains, facets, and items. Personality and Individual Differences, 171, 110546. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110546\nIn the current study, participants were invited to an online study investigating the associations among FoMO, socio-demographic factors, and personality. The final sample comprised 3370 people. Participants completed a FOMO scale and a personality inventory. The 10-item FOMO scale measured the extent of experiencing apprehension regarding missing out on interesting events of others on a 5-point scale (1 = “not at all true of me” to 5 = “extremely true of me”), producing a possible range of scores between 10 and 50. The Big Five Inventory (BFI) is a 45-item personality assessment questionnaire (note that only 43 items were used to match the study above) that uses a five-point response scale (1 = “very inapplicable” to 5 = “very applicable”). The BFI consists of five domains: Neuroticism (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Extraversion (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), Openness to Experience (10 items; possible range of scores 10-50), Agreeableness (8 items; possible range of scores 8-40), and Conscientiousness (9 items; possible range of scores 9-45). We extended the aforementioned study to include an extra socio-demographic variable - a measure of popularity on social media based on the number of followers. Unlike the original study, we do not have measures of gender, education level, or specific country of residence.\nData Dictionary\nThe data in FOMOdataset.csv contain eight attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=3370\\) hypothetical individuals across the UK, and include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nFOMO\nFoMO Score (as measured by the 10-item FoMO scale)\n\n\nAge\nAge (in years)\n\n\nN\nScore on personality items assessing Neuroticism from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nE\nScore on personality items assessing Extraversion from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nO\nScore on personality items assessing Openness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nA\nScore on personality items assessing Agreeableness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nC\nScore on personality items assessing Conscientiousness from the Big Five Inventory (BFI)\n\n\nTotalFollowers\nTotal Number of Instagram Followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOMO\n      Age\n      N\n      E\n      O\n      A\n      C\n      TotalFollowers\n    \n\n\n28\n38\n26\n30\n32\n27\n38\n98\n\n\n26\n30\n23\n27\n33\n32\n30\n192\n\n\n23\n33\n14\n30\n36\n27\n24\n177\n\n\n18\n44\n26\n21\n37\n28\n34\n119\n\n\n19\n43\n32\n21\n41\n35\n40\n278\n\n\n24\n43\n22\n25\n31\n30\n24\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the FOMO dataset into R, assigning it to an object named fomo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\n\n#Reading in fomo data and storing in object named 'fomo'\nfomo &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/FOMOdataset.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows\nhead(fomo)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   FOMO   Age     N     E     O     A     C TotalFollowers\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    28    38    26    30    32    27    38             98\n2    26    30    23    27    33    32    30            192\n3    23    33    14    30    36    27    24            177\n4    18    44    26    21    37    28    34            119\n5    19    43    32    21    41    35    40            278\n6    24    43    22    25    31    30    24            184\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

This should be coded as factor (&lt;fctr&gt;), but can see from above it is currently coded as a character (&lt;chr&gt;). Let’s correct this.\n\n#Code treatment as a factor\ncaffeine &lt;- caffeine %&gt;%\n  mutate(treatment = as_factor(treatment))\n\nNext, let’s look at the ‘wpm’ variable. Here we want to check for impossible values - i.e., cannot have a negative WPM.\n\n# all looks ok - min and max both positive values\ndescribe(caffeine$wpm)\n\n   vars  n   mean   sd median trimmed  mad    min    max range skew kurtosis\nX1    1 40 113.59 2.92 113.06  113.51 3.62 107.94 120.24  12.3 0.22    -0.84\n     se\nX1 0.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll participant data was complete (no missing values), with WPM scores within possible ranges. Treatment was coded as a factor with four levels (control (water), coffee, red bull, and mint tea).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nChoose an appropriate reference level for the Treatment condition.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe Treatment factor has a group coded ‘Control (Water)’ which lends itself naturally to be the reference category.\n\n#set 'Control' caffeine treatment condition as our reference group \ncaffeine$treatment &lt;- relevel(caffeine$treatment, \"control\")\n\n#check levels - control should be first in the list\nlevels(caffeine$treatment)\n\n[1] \"control\"  \"coffee\"   \"red_bull\" \"mint_tea\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variable)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe caffeine dataset contained information on 40 hypothetical participants who took part in an experiment examining whether the number of words typed per minute (WPM) differed among caffeine treatment conditions. Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ WPM (average number of words typed per minute), and which one of four treatment conditions they were randomly assigned to (Control (Water), Coffee, Mint Tea, or Red Bull).\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among WPM and caffeine treatment conditions. To address the research question of whether WPM differs by caffeine treatment condition, we first need to define the dummy variables for Treatment:\n\\[\nTreatment_\\text{Coffee} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Coffee} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad    \n\\]\n\\[\nTreatment_\\text{Red Bull} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Red Bull} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\\\  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\nTreatment_\\text{Mint Tea} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Treatment is Mint Tea} \\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}  \n\\end{cases}  \n\\quad  \n\\]\n\\[\n(\\text{Control (Water) is base level})  \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following regression model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{WPM} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Treatment(Coffee)} \\\\    \n+ \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Treatment(Red Bull)} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Treatment(Mint Tea)} + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are no differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment conditions.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nThere are differences in WPM based on caffeine treatment conditions."

Huntingtons patients, on the other hand, will display the opposite: they will have no deficit in explicit memory, but will have a deficit in implicit memory.\nTo test this, researchers designed a study that included two variables: ‘Diagnosis’ (Amnesic, Huntingtons, Control) and ‘Task’ (Grammar, Classification, Recognition) where participants were randomly assigned to a Task condition. The first two tasks (Grammar and Classification) are known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the Recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nExperiment 1\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 3\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: Matched pairs\nNo of variables of interest = 2 - Sleep Condition and Reaction Time\nLevels of variables = Sleep Condition has 2 levels - Sleep Deprived and Non-Sleep Deprived; Reaction Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Sleep Condition - Non-Sleep Deprived because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how the sleep deprived group differed from the non-sleep deprived group.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Within-person: repeated measures\nNo of variables of interest = 2 - Task and Response Time\nLevels of variables = Task has 2 levels - A and B; Response Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\nReference Group = Task - A because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how response time in Task B differed from the response time in Task A.\n\n\n\n\nDesign = Between-person: 3×3 factorial design\nNo of variables of interest = 2 - Diagnosis and Task\nLevels of variables = Diagnosis has 3 levels - Amnesic, Huntingtons, and Control; Task has 3 levels - Grammar, Classification, and Recognition\nReference Groups = Diagnosis - Control; Task - Recognition.

    "text": "Assumptions\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nLet’s start by using check_model() for our wb_mdl1 model - we can refer to these plots as a guide as we work through the assumptions questions of the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots cannot be used in your reports - they are to be used as a guide only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncheck_model(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe check_model() function is a useful way to check the assumptions of models, as it also returns some useful notes to aid your interpretation. There does appear to be evidence that some assumptions may have been violated, but to be sure we need to check each assumption individually with plots that are more suitable for a statistics report.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model satisfies the linearity assumption for wb_mdl1.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nHow you check this assumption depends on the number of predictors in your model:\n\nSingle predictor: Use either residual vs fitted values plot (plot(model, which = 1)), and/or a scatterplot with loess lines\n\nFor interpretation - in the former, you want the residuals appear to be randomly scattered around zero, without showing any pattern with respect to the fitted values; in the latter, the loess line should closely follow the data.\n\n\nMultiple predictors: Use component-residual plots (also known as partial-residual plots) to check the assumption of linearity.\n\nFor interpretation - you are looking for the pink line to follow a linear relationship (i.e., follow the blue line).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\ncrPlots(wb_mdl1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smoother (the pink line) follows quite closely to a linear relationship (the dashed blue line), though there was some deviation. Overall, the evidence suggested that the linearity assumption was met.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfy the equal variance (homoscedasticity) assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse residualPlots() to plot residuals against the predictor. Since we are only interested in visually assessing our assumption checks, we can suppress the curvature test output by specifying tests = FALSE.\nFor interpretation - if the assumption is met, you should see a random scatter of \\((x, y)\\) points with constant mean and variance functions i.e., the vertical spread of the residuals should roughly be the same everywhere.\n\nQuick Tip if plotting using plot(model)\nAs the residuals can be positive or negative, we can make it easier to assess equal spread by improving the ‘resolution’ of the points.\nWe can make all residuals positive by discarding the sign (take the absolute value), and then take the square root to make them closer to each other.\nA plot of \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values can be obtained via plot(model, which = 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can visually assess by plotting the Pearson residuals against the fitted values:\n\nresidualPlots(wb_mdl1, tests = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr by plotting the \\(\\sqrt{|\\text{Standardized residuals}|}\\) against the fitted values:\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial residual plots did show non-linear trends between residuals and predictors, hence there is evidence of non-constant variance i.e., heteroscedasticity. Thus, the data did not meet the assumption of equal variance, as the spread of the standardized residuals did not appear to be constant (for the most part) as the fitted values varied.\nIn the second plot, all points are above 0, but the majority of the points are not very close to each other. The line does not appear to be relatively flat, and so this also suggested that the error variance does change across the fitted values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nAssess whether there is autocorrelation in the error terms.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption of independence to have been met (you may have to assume certain aspects of the study design).\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince our data were collected from a between-persons study design, we can assume (i.e., based on design, we believe) the errors to be independent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nCheck if the fitted model wb_mdl1 satisfies the normality assumption.\nWrite a sentence summarising whether or not you consider the assumption to have been met. Justify your answer with reference to the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can get the QQplot from plot(model, which = 2), and you can plot the frequency distribution of the residuals via ggplot(data = ???, aes(x = model$residuals)) + geom_histogram().\nFor interpretation - remember that departures from a linear trend in QQ plots indicate a lack of normality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nHistogram\nQQ Plot\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = wb_mdl1$residuals)) +\n    geom_histogram() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram indicated that the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) followed close to a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(wb_mdl1, which = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe QQplot indicated that the residuals followed close to a normal distribution, as the points followed a linear pattern and there was no substantial skew or departure from normality. There was some evidence of heavier tails, and we may want to examine some observations more closely (i.e., 16, 78, 109)."

To use it with ggplot(), we will need to turn it into a dataframe (as.data.frame()), or a tibble (as_tibble()):\n\ninfdata &lt;- inf_mes$infmat %&gt;%\n  as_tibble()\n\nNow we can build our plot. It would be useful to add vertical lines at the values \\(\\quad 1\\pm0.045\\). To do so, we can use the geom_vline() function:\n\nggplot(data = infdata, aes(x = cov.r)) + \n  geom_histogram() +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1-0.045), col = \"blue\")) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = c(1+0.045), col = \"red\")) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  #remove legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like a few observations may be having quite a strong influence on the standard errors here.

Assuming that we have no issues with model specification (i.e., are not missing variables, have modeled appropriately), then we may want to consider one of the below approaches (note: this is not an exhaustive list!)\n\n\nInvestigate Observations\nSensitivity Analysis\nBootstrapping\nOLS vs WLS Regression\nData Transformations\nUsing Non-Linear Models\nRemoving Observations\n\n\n\nThe first step is to re-examine your data. It is important to be familiar with your dataset, as you need to know what values are typical, normal, and possible. Could it be the case that you have missed some impossible values (e.g., a negative value of a persons height), values outwith the possible range (e.g., a score of 55 on a survey where scores can only range 10-50), values that don’t make any sense (e.g., an age of 200), or maybe there are even typos / data entry errors (e.g., forgetting to put a decimal point, so having a height of 152m instead of 1.52m)!\nIf there is a simple error in the data, it could be that you can fix the typo. If that is not possible (maybe you didn’t collect the data, so are unsure of what the value(s) should/could be), you will need to delete the value (i.e., set as an NA), because you know that it is incorrect.\nWe should aim to never change a legitimate value where possible (and remember that if you have a large dataset, a small number of extreme values will be unlikely to have a strong influence on your results).\nIf there is an extreme, but legitimate value that you have determined is adversely influencing your model (i.e., by examining the assumptions and diagnostics as outlined above), you may want to consider ways to reduce this influence (e.g., winsorizing - which essentially truncates or caps the identified extreme values to a specified percentile, in turn reducing their influence on the model without completely eliminating the observation(s). For example, you could replace values below the 5th percentile with the 5th percentile value, and values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value).\nIf after re-examining your data you cannot identify any atypical, non-normal, or impossible values, you may need to select a different approach as outlined below.\n\n\nThis allows us to assess the sensitivity of our results (i.e., parameter estimates, p-values, confidence intervals) to changes in our modelling approach (i.e., the removal of observations).\nWe can re-fit our model after excluding our identified outliers and potentially influential observations, and compare these results to the original model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess of Removing Observations\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current example involves removing all identified outliers and potentially influential observations at the same time. Ideally, and to ensure a more thorough sensitivity analysis, you would remove each of these observations one at a time, assess the effects on the model by comparing to your original, reassessing the remaining pre-identified observations, and repeating the process if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Model\nModel with Observations Removed\nCompare summary() output\n\n\n\n\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl1 &lt;- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata) \nsummary(wb_mdl1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-15.7611  -3.1308  -0.4213   3.3126  18.8406 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We re-fit the model, excluding these 28 observations (14% of our original sample), and compared these model results (wb_mdl2) to those of our original model (wb_mdl1).\nThere was little difference in the estimates from wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2, and so we can conclude that after conducting a sensitivity analysis, there were no meaningful differences in our results, and hence our conclusions from our original model hold. Specifically:\n\nThe direction of all model estimates are the same in wb_mdl1 and wb_mdl2 (i.e., all positive)\nThere is no difference in statistical significance, and the p-values were of a similar magnitude (i.e., all &lt; .001)\nThe estimate and confidence intervals for outdoor_time are very similar\nThere are some quantitative differences in the estimate and confidence intervals for social_int. The estimate differs slightly in magnitude by 0.07), but given that this remains positive and significant, we do not need to be too concerned about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bootstrap method is an alternative non-parametric method of constructing a standard error. Instead of having to rely on calculating the standard error with a formula and potentially applying fancy mathematical corrections, bootstrapping involves mimicking the idea of “repeatedly sampling from the population”. It does so by repeatedly resampling with replacement from our original sample.\nWhat this means is that we don’t have to rely on any assumptions about our model residuals, because we actually generate an actual distribution that we can take as an approximation of our sampling distribution, meaning that we can actually look at where 95% of the distribution falls, without having to rely on any summing of squared deviations.\nNote, the bootstrap may provide us with an alternative way of conducting inference, but our model may still be mis-specified. It is also very important to remember that bootstrapping is entirely reliant on utilising our original sample to pretend that it is a population (and mimic sampling from that population). If our original sample is not representative of the population that we’re interested in, bootstrapping doesn’t help us at all.\nMore on how bootstrapping works next week!\n\n\nThe method of ordinary least squares regression (OLS: i.e., the type of regression model you have been fitting on the course) assumes that there is constant variance in the errors (homoscedasticity). The method of weighted least squares (WLS) can be used when the ordinary least squares assumption of constant variance in the errors is violated (i.e., you have evidence of heteroscedasticity, like we do in Q3 of this lab).\nIf we have some specific belief that your non-constant variance is due to differences in the variances of the outcome between various groups, then it might be better to use Weighted Least Squares.\nAs an example, imagine we are looking at weight of different dog breeds (Figure 1). The weights of chihuahuas are all quite close together (between 2 to 5kg), but the weight of, for example, spaniels is anywhere from 8 to 25kg - a much bigger variance.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The weights of 49 dogs, of 7 breeds\n\n\n\nRecall that the default way that lm() deals with categorical predictors such as dog breed, is to compare each one to a reference level. In this case, that reference level is “beagle” (first in the alphabet). Looking at Figure 1 above, which comparison do you feel more confident in?\n\n\nA: Beagles (14kg) vs Pugs (9.1kg). A difference of 4.9kg.\n\n\nB: Beagles (14kg) vs Spaniels (19kg). A difference of 5kg.\n\nHopefully, your intuition is that A looks like a clearer difference than B because there’s less overlap between Beagles and Pugs than between Beagles and Spaniels. Our standard linear model, however, assumes the standard errors are identical for each comparison:\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = weight ~ breed, data = dogdf)\n...\nCoefficients:\n                      Estimate Std.

Accordingly, the Chihuahuas are given higher weights (and so Chihuahua comparisons result in a smaller SE), and Spaniels and Retrievers are given lower weights.\n\nlibrary(nlme)\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/dogweight.RData\"))\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, \n                 weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\nsummary(dogmod_wls)\n\n\n\nCoefficients:\n                           Value Std.Error   t-value p-value\n(Intercept)            13.995640  1.044722 13.396516  0.0000\nbreedpug               -4.858097  1.271562 -3.820576  0.0004\nbreedspaniel            5.051696  2.763611  1.827933  0.0747\nbreedchihuahua        -10.077615  1.095964 -9.195207  0.0000\nbreedboxer             20.625429  1.820370 11.330351  0.0000\nbreedgolden retriever  17.922779  2.976253  6.021927  0.0000\nbreedlurcher            5.905261  1.362367  4.334559  0.0001\n\n\nWe can also apply weights that change according to continuous predictors (e.g. observations with a smaller value of \\(x\\) are given more weight than observations with larger values).\n\n\nA data transformation involves the replacement of a variable (e.g., \\(y\\)) by a function of that variable in order to change the shape of a distribution or association (e.g., to help reduce skew). We can transform the outcome variable prior to fitting the model, using something such as log(y) or sqrt(y). This will sometimes allow us to estimate a model for which our assumptions are satisfied.\nSome of the most common (not an exhaustive list) transformations are:\n\n\nLog (log(y)): Often used for reducing right skewness. Note, this transformation cannot be applied to zero or negative values (make sure to check your data!)\n\nSquare root (sqrt(y)): Also often used for reducing right skewness. This transformation can be applied to zero values (but not negative), and is commonly applied to count data\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A model of a transformed outcome variable can sometimes avoid violations of assumptions that arise when modeling the outcome variable directly. Data from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\n\n\n\nThe major downside of this is that we are no longer modelling \\(y\\), but some transformation \\(f(y)\\) (\\(y\\) with some function \\(f\\) applied to it). Interpretation of the coefficients changes accordingly, such that we are no longer talking in terms of changes in y, but changes in \\(f(y)\\). When the transformation function used is non-linear (see the Right-Hand of Figure 3) a change in \\(f(y)\\) is not the same for every \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The log transformation is non-linear\n\n\n\nFor certain transformations, we can re-express coefficients to be interpretable with respect to \\(y\\) itself. For instance, the model using a log transform \\(ln(y) = b_0 + b_1(x)\\) gives us a coefficient that represents statement A below. We can re-express this by taking the opposite function to logarithm, the exponent, exp(). Similar to how this works in logistic regression, the exponentiated coefficients obtained from exp(coef(model)) are multiplicative, meaning we can say something such as statement B\n\n\n\nA: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with a \\(b\\) unit change in \\(ln(y)\\)”.\n\n\nB: “a 1 unit change in \\(x\\) is associated with \\(e^b\\) percent change in \\(y\\).”\n\n\nFinding the optimal transformation to use can be difficult, but there are methods out there to help you. One such method is the BoxCox transformation, which can be conducted using BoxCox(variable, lambda=\"auto\"), from the forecast package.3\n\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models\nHigher Order Terms\n\n\n\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) can appropriately deal with data that do not follow a normal distribution (which is a requirement for traditional linear models). They can accommodate various types of distributions, including the Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. This makes them suitable for modelling count data (e.g., number of sunny days Edinburgh has per year - yes, count data can include 0!), binary data (where there are only two possible values e.g., doesn’t wear glasses vs wear glasses, smoker vs non-smoker, i.e., values that are yes/no or 0/1), and other types of non-normal data.\nWe will explore some GLMs later in the course (Semester 2 Block 4), where we will work with logistic regression models.\n\n\nHigher order regression terms refer to the inclusion of polynomial terms of degree higher than one in a regression model. In a linear regression model, the association between the dependent variable (\\(Y\\)) and the independent variable (\\(X\\)) is assumed to be linear, which means the association can be represented by a straight line. However, in many real-world scenarios, associations between variables are not strictly linear, and including higher order regression terms can help capture more complex relationships. Higher order terms that you could incorporate include quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial terms.\nFor example, in a quadratic regression model, the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) can be represented as:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^2 + \\epsilon\n\\] \\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& Y = \\text{Dependent Variable} \\\\\n& X = \\text{Independent Variable} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nAs in our models we’ve seen so far, \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\beta_2\\) are the coefficients to be estimated in the above model. What is different from what we’ve seen in DAPR2 is the term \\(\\beta_2 \\cdot X^2\\), and this represents the quadratic term. This allows for a curved as opposed to straight line to represent the association between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), and hence can allow us to capture more complex relationships. For example, we can model the association between height and age:\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Two linear models, one with a quadratic term (right)\n\n\n\nPlease note that these types of models are beyond the scope of the DAPR2 course, but if you want to know more, please do read up on these in your own time.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving outliers and potentially influential observations should be a last resort - not all outliers are inherently ‘bad’ - we do expect natural variation in our population(s) of interest. Outliers can be informative about the topic under investigation, and this is why you need to be very careful about excluding outliers due only to their ‘extremeness’. In doing so, you can distort your results by removing variability - i.e., by forcing the data to be more normal and less variable than it actually is, and reduce statistical power by reducing the size of your sample.\nIf you do decide to remove observations, you will need to document what specific data points you excluded, and provide an explanation as to why these were excluded.\nTo set specific values to NA in our dataset (and save this updated dataset in a new object named mwdata2), we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to set any age values of &lt;20 as NA. In the original dataset mwdata, we had 3 individuals aged 18, and 6 aged 19, so we should end up with 9 NA values in mwdata2 column age:\n\n#specify age column in original dataset, where age is &lt; 20, for values to be set to NA and save to new object named mwdata2 to avoid overwriting original data\nmwdata2 &lt;-  mwdata %&gt;% \n    mutate(age = replace(age, age &lt; 20, NA))\n\n#check how many NA values we have - there should be 9 (so 9 TRUEs):\ntable(is.na(mwdata2$age))\n\n\nFALSE  TRUE \n  191     9 \n\n\nIf we wanted to remove a full row from the datset, we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to remove all rows that were highlighted in the above assumption and diagnostic checks as potentially having an adverse influence on our model estimates:\n\n# create new dataset 'mwdata3' without (by specifying -) identified outliers and potentially influential observations\nmwdata3 &lt;- mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ]\n\n# check dimensions - should now have 32 rows less than original dataset 200 - 32 = 168\ndim(mwdata3)\n\n[1] 168   7"

Subset the data to only have those 3 columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck for missing data. There are numerous ways to deal with this. Two common commands are na.omit() and drop_na().

If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use select() after calling describe() e.g., describe() %&gt;% select(mean, sd)\n- The kableExtra package allows us to produce well formatted tables for our descriptive statistics.

Results suggested that there was a negative and statistically significant association between attitudes towards science and faith and scientific knowledge after controlling for age \\((\\beta = -0.08, CI_{95}[-0.09, -0.07])\\). Since the 95% CI did not contain zero, we rejected the null hypothesis as there was evidence of an association between peoples’ attitudes towards science and faith and their scientific knowledge after accounting for their age. Specifically, results suggested that for every additional quiz question people got correct, we expected their attitude score to be lower by about 0.08 points, holding age constant. In other words, respondents with greater scientific knowledge tended to be more favorable towards it, regardless of their age."

In the first, researchers were interested in further exploring possible predictors of attendance in university courses. They collected information from 397 students across all years of study (i.e., UG (Y1 - Y4), MSc, and PhD), and recorded their class attendance across the academic year, their level of Conscientiousness (categorized as Low, Moderate, or High), the frequency of which they accessed online course materials (categorized as Rarely, Sometimes, or Often), and the timing of class (categorized as 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM). In the second, researchers collected data from 200 students, and recorded their class attendance across the academic year and their final course grade.\nData Dictionary: Part 1\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 contain six attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=397\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\npid\nParticipant ID number\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\nConscientiousness\nConscientiousness (Levels: Low, Moderate, High)\n\n\nTime\nTime of Class (Levels: 9AM, 10AM, 11AM, 12PM, 1PM, 2PM, 3PM, 4PM)\n\n\nOnlineAccess\nFrequency of access to online course materials (Levels: Rarely, Sometimes, Often)\n\n\nYear\nYear of Study in University (Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, MsC, PhD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 1\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npid\n      Attendance\n      Conscientiousness\n      Time\n      OnlineAccess\n      Year\n    \n\n\n1\n9\nHigh\n3PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n2\n10\nHigh\n2PM\nOften\nY3\n\n\n3\n0\nLow\n10AM\nRarely\nY2\n\n\n4\n8\nLow\n4PM\nOften\nY4\n\n\n5\n6\nHigh\n4PM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n6\n6\nHigh\n9AM\nSometimes\nY1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary: Part 2\nThe data in DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 contain two attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=200\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nMarks\nFinal grade (0-100)\n\n\nAttendance\nTotal attendance (in days)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview: Part 2\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarks\n      Attendance\n    \n\n\n25.18480\n10.5\n\n\n25.83144\n11.0\n\n\n25.42314\n11.5\n\n\n26.36523\n12.0\n\n\n27.44285\n12.5\n\n\n29.04029\n13.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1 and DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2 datasets into R, assigning them to objects named data1 and data2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n#Loading the required package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(emmeans)\nlibrary(car)\n\n#Reading in two datasets and store in objects named 'data1' and  'data2'\ndata1 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart1.csv\")\ndata2 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/DapR2_S1B2_PracticalPart2.csv\")\n\n#check first six rows of each dataset\nhead(data1)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n    pid Attendance Conscientiousness Time  OnlineAccess Year \n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;\n1     1          9 High              3PM   Often        Y3   \n2     2         10 High              2PM   Often        Y3   \n3     3          0 Low               10AM  Rarely       Y2   \n4     4          8 Low               4PM   Often        Y4   \n5     5          6 High              4PM   Sometimes    Y1   \n6     6          6 High              9AM   Sometimes    Y1   \n\nhead(data2)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  Marks Attendance\n  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  25.2       10.5\n2  25.8       11  \n3  25.4       11.5\n4  26.4       12  \n5  27.4       12.5\n6  29.0       13  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvided Analysis Code\nBelow you will find the code required to conduct the analysis to address the research questions.

    "text": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variable)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\nIf we fit the interaction x1:x2, we almost always want to also fit the separate effects x1 and x2:\n\n“Except in special circumstances, a model including a product term for interaction between two explanatory variables should also include terms with each of the explanatory variables individually, even though their coefficients may not be significantly different from zero. Following this rule avoids the logical inconsistency of saying that the effect of \\(X_1\\) depends on the level of \\(X_2\\) but that there is no effect of \\(X_1\\).”\n— Ramsey and Schafer (2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe mwdata dataset contained information on 200 hypothetical participants who lived in Edinburgh & Lothians area. Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants’ wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, and the strength of association between the two variables estimated via the correlation coefficient. To understand how these associations differ between rural and non-rural locations, scatterplots will be used.\nTo address the research question of whether the association between the number of social interactions and wellbeing differs between rural and non-rural residents, we are going to fit the following interaction model (where not rural will be specified as the reference group for location).\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Wellbeing} ~=~ & \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\beta_2 \\cdot Location_{Rural} \\\\\n& + \\beta_3 \\cdot (Social~Interactions \\cdot Location_{Rural}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\quad\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha=.05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0: \\beta_3 = 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\\(H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0\\)\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nCheck coding of variables (e.g., that categorical variables are coded as factors).\nNote that the “location” variable currently has three levels (Rural/Suburb/City). In order to address the research question, we only want two (Rural/Not Rural) locations - you will need to fix this.\nAs specified in Q1, we want ‘not rural’ as the reference group, so make sure to specify this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to do this would be to use ifelse() to define a variable which takes one value (“Rural”) if the observation meets from some condition, or another value (“Not Rural”) if it does not.\nType ?ifelse in the console if you want to see the help function. You can use it to add a new variable either inside mutate(), or using data$new_variable_name &lt;- ifelse(test, x, y) syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nCreate a new variable for Rural/Not Rural, and then assign as a factor:\n\n#if location is rural, assign name 'rural'. If another value (i.e., city or suburb) assign name 'not rural'.\n# In other words, if location = rural assign name rural; if location != rural then assign name not rural.\nmwdata &lt;- mwdata %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    isRural = ifelse(location == \"rural\", \"rural\", \"not rural\"),\n    isRural = as_factor(isRural)\n  )\n\nCheck coding of variables within mwdata and ensure isRural is a factor with two levels, ‘rural’ and ‘not rural’:\n\n# check structure of dataset (alternatively run is.factor() for specific variable)\nstr(mwdata) \n\ntibble [200 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ age         : num [1:200] 28 56 25 60 19 34 41 41 35 53 ...\n $ outdoor_time: num [1:200] 12 5 19 25 9 18 17 11 12 13 ...\n $ social_int  : num [1:200] 13 15 11 15 18 13 19 12 13 15 ...\n $ routine     : num [1:200] 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 ...\n $ wellbeing   : num [1:200] 36 41 35 35 32 34 39 43 35 37 ...\n $ location    : chr [1:200] \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" \"rural\" ...\n $ steps_k     : num [1:200] 21.6 12.3 49.8 NA 48.1 67.3 1.9 50.9 NA 35.5 ...\n $ isRural     : Factor w/ 2 levels \"rural\",\"not rural\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n\n#check that isRural is now a factor\nis.factor(mwdata$isRural) \n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n#specify 'not rural' as reference group\nmwdata$isRural &lt;- relevel(mwdata$isRural, 'not rural')"

This will save you the time you would have spent creating individual plots, but is only useful for continuous variables.\n\nTo include facets, within your ggplot() argument you will need to specify + facet_wrap() in order to produce facets for each location. It would also be useful to specify geom_smooth(method=\"lm\").\nTo include different colours for each location, you will need to specify colour = isRural within your ggplot() argument, as well as + scale_colour_discrete() to state the name = of your legend and the labels = associated with each coloured line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nNumeric\nVisual\n\n\n\nWe can present our summary statistics for wellbeing and social interactions grouped by location in a well formatted table using kable():\n\nmwdata %&gt;%\n    select(isRural, wellbeing, social_int) %&gt;%\n    group_by(isRural) %&gt;%\n    summarise(Wellbeing_M = mean(wellbeing),\n              Wellbeing_SD = sd(wellbeing),\n              SocialInt_M = mean(social_int),\n              SocialInt_SD = sd(social_int)) %&gt;%\n    kable(caption = \"Wellbeing, Social Interactions, and Location Descriptive Statistics\", align = \"c\", digits = 2, booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Wellbeing, Social Interactions, and Location Descriptive Statistics\n\nisRural\nWellbeing_M\nWellbeing_SD\nSocialInt_M\nSocialInt_SD\n\n\n\nnot rural\n38.57\n5.66\n11.67\n3.95\n\n\nrural\n34.02\n3.99\n12.46\n4.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick non-APA style table - i.e., not for use in reports\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a quick overview of several summary statistics at once for all columns of our dataframe, but separately for each level of location (i.e.,rural and non-rural), you can use describeBy() from the psych package:\n\ndescribeBy(mwdata, mwdata$isRural)\n\n\n Descriptive statistics by group \ngroup: not rural\n             vars   n  mean    sd median trimmed   mad  min   max range  skew\nage             1 100 43.01 14.95   41.5   42.74 18.53 18.0  70.0  52.0  0.13\noutdoor_time    2 100 18.72  6.91   18.0   18.61  7.41  6.0  34.0  28.0  0.08\nsocial_int      3 100 11.67  3.95   12.0   11.51  3.71  3.0  24.0  21.0  0.37\nroutine         4 100  0.54  0.50    1.0    0.55  0.00  0.0   1.0   1.0 -0.16\nwellbeing       5 100 38.57  5.66   39.0   38.36  5.93 26.0  59.0  33.0  0.44\nlocation*       6 100  1.43  0.50    1.0    1.41  0.00  1.0   2.0   1.0  0.28\nsteps_k         7  68 51.03 26.14   49.6   50.56 31.58  2.9 111.3 108.4  0.15\nisRural*        8 100  1.00  0.00    1.0    1.00  0.00  1.0   1.0   0.0   NaN\n             kurtosis   se\nage             -1.13 1.49\noutdoor_time    -0.87 0.69\nsocial_int       0.13 0.39\nroutine         -1.99 0.05\nwellbeing        0.38 0.57\nlocation*       -1.94 0.05\nsteps_k         -0.94 3.17\nisRural*          NaN 0.00\n------------------------------------------------------------ \ngroup: rural\n             vars   n  mean    sd median trimmed   mad min   max range  skew\nage             1 100 41.59 14.85  42.00   41.38 17.79  18  69.0  51.0  0.09\noutdoor_time    2 100 17.79  7.29  18.00   17.68  7.41   1  35.0  34.0  0.06\nsocial_int      3 100 12.46  4.08  12.00   12.41  4.45   4  21.0  17.0  0.05\nroutine         4 100  0.59  0.49   1.00    0.61  0.00   0   1.0   1.0 -0.36\nwellbeing       5 100 34.02  3.99  34.00   34.08  2.97  22  45.0  23.0 -0.07\nlocation*       6 100  1.00  0.00   1.00    1.00  0.00   1   1.0   0.0   NaN\nsteps_k         7  66 38.63 26.64  35.15   37.00 30.62   0 110.6 110.6  0.45\nisRural*        8 100  2.00  0.00   2.00    2.00  0.00   2   2.0   0.0   NaN\n             kurtosis   se\nage             -1.18 1.49\noutdoor_time    -0.49 0.73\nsocial_int      -0.82 0.41\nroutine         -1.89 0.05\nwellbeing        0.40 0.40\nlocation*         NaN 0.00\nsteps_k         -0.59 3.28\nisRural*          NaN 0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWellbeing & Social Interactions\nWellbeing & Location\nWellbeing, Social Interactions & Location\n\n\n\nLet’s first plot the continuous variables included within our model (note that we could use this for the whole dataset, but we don’t want to include irrelevant / non-continuous variables):\n\nmwdata %&gt;% \n  select(wellbeing, social_int) %&gt;%\n  pairs.panels()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWellbeing and social interactions appear to follow unimodal distributions. There was a weak, positive association between wellbeing and social interactions \\((r = .24)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nNow lets look at wellbeing scores by location:\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = isRural, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Location\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in rural locations appear to have lower wellbeing scores in comparison to those in non-rural locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, lets produce our plots with a facet for rural vs non-rural residents:\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~isRural, labeller = \"label_both\") + \n  labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr instead of facets, we could use different colors for each location (rural vs non-rural):\n\nggplot(data = mwdata, aes(x = social_int, y = wellbeing, colour = isRural)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) +\n    scale_colour_discrete(\n    name =\"Location\",\n    labels=c(\"Not Rural\", \"Rural\")) + \n    labs(x = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\", y = \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in non-rural locations appear to have higher wellbeing scores across almost all levels of social interactions. The slopes appear to be different for each location, where the greatest difference in wellbeing scores by location is most visible the highest number of social interactions. This suggests that there may be an interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we know there might be an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lines in the two plots above do not run in parallel - this suggested the presence of an interaction. Specifically in our example, the non-parallel lines suggested an interaction effect based on location, as the number of social interactions did not appear to have the same influence on rural and non-rural residents’ wellbeing scores.\nHowever, the only way we can determine whether there is actually an interaction is by including an interaction term in our model, and testing this."

Note that we can see that the model doesn’t change, it is just extracting different information (the distance to move from the blue dot to the red dot is different):\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Difference when social interactions is not vs is mean centered"

A significant conditional association was also evident between wellbeing and location \\((\\beta = -4.86,~ SE = 0.65,~ t(196) = -7.50,~ p &lt; .001)\\), which suggested that for those who have the average number of social interactions per week \\((M = 12.06)\\), wellbeing scores were 4.86 points lower for those in rural areas in comparison to those in non-rural.\nThe association between wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) and social interactions was found to be dependent upon location (rural/non-rural), and this was significant \\((\\beta = -0.52,~ SE = 0.16,~ t(196) = -3.21, ~p = .002)\\). The expected increase in wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores) for every additional social interaction per week was 0.52 points less for those living in rural locations in comparison to those in non-rural. This interaction is visually presented in Figure 4. Therefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area)."

For both of these measures, only total scores were available. Items in the SCS were measured on a 5-point scale, giving minimum and maximum possible scores of 11 and 55 respectively.

To understand the strength of association among the variables, we will estimate the the correlation coefficients; and to visualise these associations scatterplots will be used.

It takes the dataset, and uses the cut() function to add a new variable called “zn_group”, which is the “zn” variable split into 4 groups.\n\nscs_study &lt;-\n  scs_study %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    zn_group = cut(zn, 4)\n  )\n\nWe can see how it has split the “zn” variable by plotting the two against one another (note that the levels of the new variable are named according to the cut-points):\n\nggplot(data = scs_study, aes(x = zn_group, y = zn)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the association between scores on the SCS and scores on the DASS-21, for each group of the variable we just created.\nHow does the pattern differ across groups? Does it suggest an interaction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than creating four separate plots, you might want to map some feature of the plot to the variable we created in the data, or make use of facet_wrap() / facet_grid().\nRemember that you can specify geom_smooth() to add a trend line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nggplot(data = scs_study, aes(x = scs, y = dass, col = zn_group)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method='lm', se = FALSE) +\n  facet_grid(~zn_group) +\n  labs(x = \"SCS Scores \", y = \"DASS-21 Scores\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # removes the legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between DASS-21 scores and SCS scores appears to be different across these groups. For those with a relatively high Neuroticism score, the association seems stronger, while for those with a low Neuroticism score there is almost no discernible association.\nThis does suggest an interaction - the association of DASS-21 ~ SCS differed across the values of Neuroticism.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Interaction Terms\nCutting one of the explanatory variables up into groups essentially turns a numeric variable into a categorical one. We did this just to make it easier to visualise how an association differs across the values of another variable, because we can imagine a separate line for the association between SCS and DASS-21 scores for each of the groups of Neuroticism. However, in grouping a numeric variable like this we lose information. Neuroticism is measured on a continuous scale, and we want to capture how the association between SCS and DASS-21 differs across that continuum (rather than cutting it into chunks).\nWe could imagine cutting it into more and more chunks (see Figure 1), until what we end up with is an infinite number of lines - i.e., a three-dimensional plane/surface (recall that in for a multiple regression model with 2 explanatory variables, we can think of the model as having three-dimensions). The inclusion of the interaction term simply results in this surface no longer being necessarily flat. You can see this in Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Separate regression lines DASS ~ SCS for Neuroticism when cut into 4 (left) or 6 (center) or 12 (right) groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 3D plot of regression surface with interaction.

The \\(F\\)-test for model utility was significant \\((F(3,652) = 48.50, p&lt;.001)\\), and the model explained approximately 17.87% of the variability in DASS-21 scores.\nThere was a significant conditional association between DASS-21 Scores and SCS scores (\\(Z\\)-scored) \\((\\beta = -1.57, SE = 0.24, p &lt; .001)\\), suggesting that for those with Neuroticism scores of 0, DASS-21 scores decreased by 1.57 for every 1 standard deviation increase in SCS scores.\nA significant conditional association was also evident between DASS-21 Scores and Neuroticism (\\(Z\\)-scored) \\((\\beta = 1.58, SE = 0.24, p &lt;.001)\\), suggesting that for those with SCS scores of 0, DASS-21 scores increased by 1.58 for every 1 standard deviation increase in Neuroticism.\nThe association between symptoms of depression and anxiety (DASS-21 scores) and social comparison was found to be dependent upon the level of Neuroticism, with a greater negative association between the two for those with higher levels of Neuroticism \\((\\beta = -1.83, SE = 0.23, p &lt;.001)\\). For every standard deviation increase in SCS Scores, the change in DASS-21 scores associated with an increase of 1 SD in Neuroticism was adjusted by -1.83. Thus, Neuroticism buffered the association between DASS-21 scores and SCS - this is visually displayed in Figure 3. We further used the Johnson-Neyman technique to probe the interaction, and to identify regions of significance. We identified that Neuroticism values (z-scored) outside the range of -1.28 to -0.55 were significant (see Figure 4).\nTherefore, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis (that the effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism)."

Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 10 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were randomly assigned to one of two ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar or Recognition. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder, and as there is no natural reference group for Diagnosis, we chose to leave this as ‘Grammar’.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions.

    "text": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nFirstly, examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.\nNext, consider what would be the most appropriate coding constraint to apply in order to best address the research question - i.e., are we interested in whether group X (e.g., Amnesic) differed from group Y (e.g., Huntingtons), or whether group X (e.g., Amnesic) differed from the grand mean?\nChoose appropriate reference levels for the Diagnosis and Task variables based on your decision above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think you’d benefit from a refresher on coding constraints, it might be best to revisit the materials from Semester 1 Block 2.\nIn terms of data management:\n- Convert categorical variables to factors\n- Label appropriately factors to aid with your model interpretations\n- If needed, provide better variable names\nNote that all of these steps can be done in combination - the mutate() and factor() functions will likely be useful here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nLet’s have a look at the data to see what we’re working with - str() or head() are a good place to start - and then we should check for any missing data (NA values):\n\n#first look at dataset structure\nstr(cog)\n\nspc_tbl_ [45 × 3] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Diagnosis: num [1:45] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ Task     : num [1:45] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Y        : num [1:45] 44 63 76 72 45 72 66 55 82 75 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   Diagnosis = col_double(),\n  ..   Task = col_double(),\n  ..   Y = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#now lets look at top 6 rows (or the head) of the dataset\nhead(cog)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Diagnosis  Task     Y\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         1     1    44\n2         1     1    63\n3         1     1    76\n4         1     1    72\n5         1     1    45\n6         1     2    72\n\n#check for NAs \ntable(is.na(cog))\n\n\nFALSE \n  135 \n\n# there are none - all FALSE\n\nNext, lets convert Diagnosis and Task into factors, making the labels of each factor level more meaningful. According to the data description, the encoding of the factor Diagnosis is: 1 = amnesic patients, 2 = Huntingtons patients, and 3 = Control patients. The encoding for the factor Task is: 1 = grammar task, 2 = classification task, and 3 = recognition task.\n\ncog &lt;- cog %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        Diagnosis = factor(Diagnosis, \n                           levels = c(1, 2, 3),\n                           labels = c('amnesic', 'huntingtons', 'control'),\n                           ordered = FALSE),\n        Task = factor(Task, \n                      levels = c(1, 2, 3),\n                      labels = c('grammar', 'classification', 'recognition'),\n                      ordered = FALSE)) %&gt;%\n    rename(Score = Y)\n\nSince we are interested in comparing groups, we should use dummy coding. By default, R uses dummy coding, so we do not need to make any changes to the coding constraint.\nHowever, for our reference groups, we’re likely to want it to be the Control group for Diagnosis, and recognition for Task:\n\ncog$Diagnosis &lt;- fct_relevel(cog$Diagnosis, \"control\")\ncog$Task &lt;- fct_relevel(cog$Task, \"recognition\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study (you might be able to re-use some of the content you wrote for Semester 2 Week 3 lab here, but note that we now have an extra condition within Task)\nOutline data checks / data cleaning\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question (note that you will need to specify the reference level of your categorical variables. This will be somewhat similar to last week, but with the addition of Classification in Task, our model will contain a different number of parameters)\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe cog dataset contained information on 45 hypothetical participants from a between-subjects study. Participants belonged to one of three ‘Diagnosis’ groups, which had 15 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were equally and randomly assigned to one of three ‘Tasks’ to measure different memory processes - Grammar, Classification, or Recognition - the former two measuring implicit memory and the latter explicit. This resulted in 5 participants from each Diagnosis group in each of the three Task conditions.\nAll participant data was complete, and categorical variables were coded as factors. For the purpose of this analysis, ‘Control’ was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder. For Task, the recognition task measures explicit memory whereas the other two measure implicit memory, so this was specified as the reference group.\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions. To address the research question of whether the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls, we first need to define the dummy variables for both\nDiagnosis:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\nD_\\text{Amnesic} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic}\\\\  \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\\\  \n\\\\  \nD_\\text{Huntingtons} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad   \n\\\\  \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Control is base level})  \n\\end{gather*}\n\\]\nand for Task:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}    \nT_\\text{Grammar} = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if Task is Grammar}\\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\  \n\\end{cases}\\\n\\\\  \n\\\\\nT_\\text{Classification} = \\begin{cases}  \n1 & \\text{if Task is Classification}\\\\   \n0 & \\text{otherwise}\\\\\n\\end{cases}\\\\\\  \n\\quad    \n\\\\    \n\\\\  \n(\\text{Recognition is base level})\\\\\n\\end{gather*}   \n\\]\nBased on the above dummy coding, we are going to fit the following interaction model:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Interaction Model}: \\text{Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot D_\\text{Amnseic} + \\beta_2 \\cdot  D_\\text{Huntingtons}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot  T_\\text{Grammar}  + \\beta_4 \\cdot  T_\\text{Classification}  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (D_\\text{Amnseic} \\cdot  T_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (D_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  T_\\text{Grammar})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (D_\\text{Amnseic} \\cdot  T_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_8 \\cdot  (D_\\text{Huntingtons} \\cdot  T_\\text{Classification})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are no significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s).\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 5, 6, 7, 8\\))\nThere are significant differences in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks for patients with different cognitive impairment(s)."

This corresponds to a contrast with coefficients of 0.5, 0.5, and −1 for the three tasks.\nWhen we are in presence of a significant interaction, the coefficients for a contrast between the means are found by multiplying each row coefficient with all column coefficients as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the coefficients to be used in the contrast analysis, and present in a table.\nNext, formally state the contrast that the researchers were interested in as testable hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nWe can specify the coefficients to be used in the contrast analysis in R using either:\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\n\n\ndiag_coef  &lt;- c('control' = 0, 'amnesic' = 1, 'huntingtons' = -1)\ntask_coef  &lt;- c('grammar' = 0.5, 'classification' = 0.5, 'recognition' = -1)\ncontr_coef &lt;- outer(diag_coef, task_coef)\ncontr_coef\n\n            grammar classification recognition\ncontrol         0.0            0.0           0\namnesic         0.5            0.5          -1\nhuntingtons    -0.5           -0.5           1\n\n\n\n\n\ndiag_coef  &lt;- c('control' = 0, 'amnesic' = 1, 'huntingtons' = -1)\ntask_coef  &lt;- c('grammar' = 0.5, 'classification' = 0.5, 'recognition' = -1)\ncontr_coef &lt;- diag_coef %o% task_coef\ncontr_coef\n\n            grammar classification recognition\ncontrol         0.0            0.0           0\namnesic         0.5            0.5          -1\nhuntingtons    -0.5           -0.5           1\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing either approach, we can then convert into a well-formatted table:\n\ncontr_coef %&gt;% \n    kable(., caption = \"Contrast Weights\") %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) \n\n\n\nTable 3: Contrast Weights\n\n\ngrammar\nclassification\nrecognition\n\n\n\ncontrol\n0.0\n0.0\n0\n\n\namnesic\n0.5\n0.5\n-1\n\n\nhuntingtons\n-0.5\n-0.5\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above coefficients correspond to the following hypotheses:\n\\[\nH_0: \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3} \\right) = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3} \\right) \\neq 0\n\\]\nwhich can be equivalently specified as:\n\\[\nH_0: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\n\\]\n\\[  \nH_1: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad \\neq \\quad  \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\n\\]\nboth statements state that, in the population, the difference between the mean implicit memory and the explicit memory score is the same for individuals with amnesia and Huntingtons.\nNote that the scores for the grammar and classification tasks have been averaged to obtain a single measure of ‘implicit memory’ score.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nFirstly, use emmeans() to obtain the estimated means and uncertainties for your factors.\nNext, specify the coefficients of the comparison and run the contrast analysis, obtaining 95% confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nNow that we have the coefficients, let’s firstly call the emmeans function to get the estimated means of our groups (this is also helpful to look at the ordering of the groups):\n\ndiag_task_mean &lt;- emmeans(mdl_int, ~ Diagnosis*Task)\ndiag_task_mean\n\n Diagnosis   Task           emmean   SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n control     recognition        95 5.62 36     83.6    106.4\n amnesic     recognition        65 5.62 36     53.6     76.4\n huntingtons recognition        95 5.62 36     83.6    106.4\n control     grammar            80 5.62 36     68.6     91.4\n amnesic     grammar            60 5.62 36     48.6     71.4\n huntingtons grammar            40 5.62 36     28.6     51.4\n control     classification     80 5.62 36     68.6     91.4\n amnesic     classification     70 5.62 36     58.6     81.4\n huntingtons classification     45 5.62 36     33.6     56.4\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\nNext, from contr_coef, insert the coefficients following the order specified by the rows of diag_task_mean above. That is, the first one should be for control recognition and have a value of 0, the second for amnesic recognition with a value of -1, and so on…\nLet’s specify our weights, and give a name to this contrast (in this example ‘Research Hyp’):\n\ndiag_task_comp &lt;- contrast(diag_task_mean, \n                     method = list('Research Hyp' = c(0, -1, 1, 0, 0.5, -0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5))\n                     )\n\nNext, let’s look at the output via one of two ways:\n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\n\n\n\n#examine output\ndiag_task_comp\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df t.ratio p.value\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36   5.396  &lt;.0001\n\n#obtain confidence intervals\nconfint(diag_task_comp)\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df lower.CL upper.CL\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36     32.8     72.2\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n\n\n#examine summary output and state `infer = TRUE` to include confidence intervals\nsummary(diag_task_comp, infer = TRUE)\n\n contrast     estimate   SE df lower.CL upper.CL t.ratio p.value\n Research Hyp     52.5 9.73 36     32.8     72.2   5.396  &lt;.0001\n\nConfidence level used: 0.95 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe performed a test against \\(H_0: \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{2,1} + \\mu_{2,2}}{2} - \\mu_{2,3} \\quad = \\quad \\frac{\\mu_{3,1} + \\mu_{3,2}}{2} - \\mu_{3,3}\\). At the 5% significance level, there was evidence that individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons did differ in the difference between implicit and explicit memory tasks \\(t(36) = 5.40, p &lt; .001, \\text{two-sided})\\), and this difference was estimated to be 52.50. We are 95% confident that the difference in implicit and explicit memory scores between individuals with Amnesia and Huntingtons was between 32.80 to 72.20 points. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that the difference in differences was equal to zero."

If so, what are these specific differences?\n\n\n\n Note Taking: Data Codebook\n\n\nDescription\nThe data used for this write-up exercise are simulated, drawing on a research paper that explored the association between student note taking, and performance when answering different types of questions. The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nMueller, P. A., & Oppenheimer, D. M. (2014). The pen is mightier than the keyboard: Advantages of longhand over laptop note taking. Psychological Science, 25(6), 1159–1168. https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614524581\nIn the current study, participants were invited to take part in a study investigating the the medium of note taking and study time on test scores. The sample comprised of 160 students who took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop or longhand (i.e., using pen and paper). After watching the lecture and taking notes, they then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no, minimal, moderate, or extensive study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. After engaging in study for their allocated time, participants took a test on the lecture content.

Remember, your analysis strategy should not contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:\n\nVery brief data and design description:\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\nSpecify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n\nData management:\n\nDescribe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\nAre there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many?\nDescribe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\nModel specification:\n\nClearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\nWhat type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\nIn some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification.\nSpecify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data.\n* Specify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these.\n\n\n\n\n*** Note, given time constraints in labs, we have not included any reference to diagnostic checks in this write-up example - you would be expected to include this in your report. You can find more information on diagnostic checks in the S1 Week 9 Lab and S1 Week 9 Lectures.\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see Lesson 4 of the Rmd Bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\n\n\nThe notes dataset contained information on 160 participants who took part in a study concerning the role(s) of note taking and study time on test scores. Participants took notes on a lecture via one of two mediums - either on a laptop \\((n = 80)\\) or long-hand using pen and paper \\((n = 80)\\). They were then randomly allocated to one of four study time conditions, either engaging in no \\((n = 40)\\), minimal \\((n = 40)\\), moderate \\((n = 40)\\), or extensive \\((n = 40)\\) study of the notes taken on their assigned medium. Participants then answered a series of questions based on the lecture content. The maximum score was 100, where higher scores reflected better test performance.\nThe aim of this report was to address the following two research questions:\n\nDo differences in test scores between study conditions differ by the note-taking medium used?\nAre there differences in test scores between participants when comparing pairs of study and note-taking conditions? If so, what are these specific differences?\n\nAll participant data was complete, and test scores within range i.e., 0-100. Categorical variables were coded as factors, where ‘No’ was designated as the reference level for study condition, and ‘Longhand’ as the reference level for medium.\nTo investigate whether study condition (No, Minimal, Moderate, Extensive) and note-taking medium (Longhand, Laptop) interacted to influence test scores, a two-way ANOVA model was used. Effects were considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). Using dummy coding, the following model specification was used:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Test Score} &= \\beta_0  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_1 \\cdot S_\\text{Minimal} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_2 \\cdot S_\\text{Moderate} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_3 \\cdot S_\\text{Extensive} \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_4 \\cdot M_\\text{Laptop} \\\\        \n      &+ \\beta_5 \\cdot  (S_\\text{Minimal} \\cdot M_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_6 \\cdot  (S_\\text{Moderate} \\cdot M_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\beta_7 \\cdot  (S_\\text{Extensive} \\cdot M_\\text{Laptop})  \\\\\n      &+ \\epsilon  \n\\end{align}\n\\]\nwhere we tested whether there was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{All}~~ \\beta_j = 0 ~\\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\text{At least one}~ \\beta_j \\neq \\text{(for j = 5, 6, 7)}\n\\]\nAs we were using between-subjects datasets, we assumed independence of our error terms. We assumed linearity as all predictor variables were categorical. Equal variances was assessed via partial residual plots (residuals should be evenly spread across the range of fitted values, where the spread should be constant across the range of fitted values), and normality was assessed via a qqplot of the residuals (points should follow along the diagonal line).\nTo address RQ2 and explore if there are pairwise differences and determine which conditions significantly differed from each other, we will conduct a series of pairwise comparisons. Since we are interested in all pairwise comparisons of means, we will apply a Tukey correction.\n\n\n\nAct II: Results\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults - What To Include***\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics***).\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You don’t want to overload the reader with unnecessary or duplicate information, and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can.\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Results Section\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\n\nstudy\nmedium\nM_Score\nSD_Score\nSE_Score\nMin_Score\nMax_Score\n\n\n\nNo\nLonghand\n51.02\n2\n0.45\n48.02\n54.92\n\n\nNo\nLaptop\n48.12\n2\n0.45\n44.86\n51.16\n\n\nMinimal\nLonghand\n60.91\n2\n0.45\n57.84\n65.29\n\n\nMinimal\nLaptop\n55.57\n2\n0.45\n52.07\n60.10\n\n\nModerate\nLonghand\n80.69\n2\n0.45\n76.34\n84.64\n\n\nModerate\nLaptop\n59.30\n2\n0.45\n55.77\n62.98\n\n\nExtensive\nLonghand\n90.58\n2\n0.45\n86.82\n94.32\n\n\nExtensive\nLaptop\n61.16\n2\n0.45\n56.93\n64.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the No and Minimal study conditions, there did not appear to be differences in test score between those using a laptop or longhand when note-taking. However, those in the longhand note-taking condition scored higher than those using laptops in the moderate and extensive study conditions. This suggested that there may be an interaction (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between Test Score and Medium / Study Conditions\n\n\n\nTest scores were analysed with a 4 (study: no vs minimal vs moderate vs extensive) \\(\\times\\) 2 (medium: longhand vs laptop) between-subjects ANOVA.\nThe model met assumptions of linearity and independence (see Appendix A, top left panel of Figure 4; residuals were randomly scattered with a mean of zero and there was no clear dependence), homoscedasticity (see Appendix A, bottom left panel of Figure 4; there was a constant spread of residuals), and normality (see Appendix A, top right panel of Figure 4; the QQplot showed very little deviation from the diagonal line).\nThere was a significant interaction between study condition and note-taking medium \\(F(7, 152) = 1081, p &lt; . 001\\). Full regression results, including 95% Confidence Intervals, are shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: RQ1 - Regression Table for Total Scores Model\n\n\n \ntest score\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\nIntercept\n51.02\n50.14 – 51.90\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Minimal\n9.89\n8.64 – 11.14\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Moderate\n29.67\n28.42 – 30.92\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Extensive\n39.56\n38.31 – 40.81\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nMedium - Laptop\n-2.90\n-4.15 – -1.65\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Minimal : Medium - Laptop\n-2.44\n-4.21 – -0.67\n0.007\n\n\nStudy - Moderate : Medium - Laptop\n-18.49\n-20.26 – -16.72\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nStudy - Extensive : Medium - Laptop\n-26.52\n-28.29 – -24.75\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n160\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.980 / 0.979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs displayed in Figure 2, results suggested that the difference in scores did differ significantly across the note-taking medium and study conditions, where scores differences appeared to get larger as the period of study increased (i.e., there was little difference between longhand and laptop note-taking conditions when participants engaged in no study, but the gap in test scores seemed to grow as the length of study time increased).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Interaction Plot\n\n\n\nTo explore the interaction further, and address RQ2, pairwise comparisons were conducted. Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference comparisons (see Figure 3) indicated that the vast majority of pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. There were only three pairs of comparisons that were not - those in the minimal longhand condition did not significantly differ from those in either the moderate laptop (95% CI [-0.33 - 3.55]) or extensive laptop (95% CI [-2.19 - 1.69]) conditions; and there was no difference between those in the laptop condition who studied either for a moderate or extensive period of time (95% CI [-3.80 - 0.08]). Overall, test differences appeared more pronounced when using the longhand note-taking medium across study conditions.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Tukey HSD Pairwise Comparisons\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct III: Discussion\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question.\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\n\n\nThe findings indicated that, in general, people who engaged in no study regardless of note-taking medium performed at chance level. Overall, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests regardless of study time in comparison to those who took notes by hand. Our results led us to reject the null hypothesis, as the results indicated that the association between study condition and note-taking medium did interact to influence test scores. The direction of this association was somewhat surprising, as it suggested that laptop use can negatively influence performance on educational tests, and that engaging in hours of study is not enough to mitigate these effects.\n\n\n\nAssumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nGiven we want to keep the report as concise as possible, we may wish to utilize the appendix to present assumption and diagnostic plots. We must however ensure that:\n\nWe have described what assumptions we will check in the analysis strategy, including how we will evaluate them\nWe have summarized the evaluations of our assumptions and diagnostic checks in the results section of the main report\nWe have accurately refereed to the figures and tables labels presented in the appendix in the main report (if we don’t refer to them, the reader won’t know what they are relevant to!)\n\n\n\n\n\n Example Assumptions & Diagnostics Appendix\n\n\nAppendix A\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Assumption Plots"

It is impossible to judge how many participants would be required to detect a small effect size (green line) - we would suggest that they conduct their own power calculation as it is too difficult to judge based on the figure alone.\nGenerally, if they want to be able to detect a medium-large effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), it appears that there is little gain in recruiting a sample size &gt; ~110. However, if they want to be able to detect a small effect with 90% power using \\(\\alpha = .05\\), they are likely going to require a very large sample size.\nTo summarise the association between effect size and sample size, it appears that the smaller the effect you are trying to detect, the larger the sample size you will require."

    "text": "Study & Analysis Plan Overview\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nFirstly, examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.\nNext, think about the scales that the variables are currently on, with a particular focus on BAC, age, and condition. Consider:\n\nDo you want BAC on the current scale, or could you transform it somehow? Consider that instead of the coefficient representing the difference when moving from 0% to 1% BAC (1% blood alcohol is fatal!), we might want to have the difference associated with 0% to 0.01% BAC (i.e, a we want to talk about effects in terms of changing 1/100th of a percentage of BAC)\nDo you want age to be centred at 0 years (as it currently is), or could you re-centre to make it more meaningful?\nIn your data management, you will hopefully make condition a factor, but have you considered the reference level? It would likely make most sense for this to be set as “Low”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConvert categorical variables to factors\nLabel appropriately factors to aid with your model interpretations if required\nIf needed, provide better variable names\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nLet’s examine the data:\n\n#look at structure of data\nstr(drunkdoor)\n\nspc_tbl_ [120 × 5] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ id       : chr [1:120] \"ID1\" \"ID2\" \"ID3\" \"ID4\" ...\n $ bac      : num [1:120] 0.06744 0.00331 0.00323 0.07984 0.06676 ...\n $ age      : num [1:120] 43 64 44 67 62 45 50 45 48 61 ...\n $ condition: chr [1:120] \"Low\" \"Low\" \"Low\" \"High\" ...\n $ notice   : num [1:120] 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   id = col_character(),\n  ..   bac = col_double(),\n  ..   age = col_double(),\n  ..   condition = col_character(),\n  ..   notice = col_double()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=&lt;externalptr&gt; \n\n#check for NAs - there are none - all FALSE\ntable(is.na(drunkdoor))\n\n\nFALSE \n  600 \n\n\nNext we need to specify Condition as a factor, and set ‘Low’ as the reference group:\n\n#re-assign categorical IVs as factors\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- factor(drunkdoor$condition,\n                              levels = c(\"Low\", \"High\"))\n\n\n#set 'low' as reference group\ndrunkdoor$condition &lt;- fct_relevel(drunkdoor$condition, \"Low\")\n\nIt may be more useful to have blood alcohol (BAC) in terms of 100ths of percentages, rather than percentages, for the reasons noted above. It would also be more useful for interpretation to have age centered on the mean (note that this won’t change anything other than the intercept in our model). Let’s make both these changes:\n\ndrunkdoor &lt;- drunkdoor %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    bac100 = bac*100,\n    age_mc = age - mean(age)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nProvide a brief overview of the study design and data, before detailing your analysis plan to address the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of the study\nState what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question\nSpecify the model to be fitted to address the research question\nSpecify your chosen significance (\\(\\alpha\\)) level\nState your hypotheses\n\nMuch of the information required can be found in the Study Overview codebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nThe drunkdoor dataset contained information on 120 hypothetical participants who were approached within the vicinity of a number of establishments with licenses to sell alcohol to be consumed on-premises. Using a between-subjects design experimental design, experimenters manipulated perceptual load in two ways (door appearance and number of papers held by experimenters) to create low- and high-load conditions. In the low-load condition, the door was a standard MDF construction painted in a neutral grey, and the experimenters handled only 2 sheets of paper which had minimal printed text. In the high-load condition, the door was painted with detailed graffiti and had numerous pieces of paper and notices attached to the side facing the participants, and the experimenters held a pile of 30 papers containing drawings and printed text. Experimenters recorded whether or not participants noticed the mid-conversation experimenter swap (no = 0, yes = 1). The researchers also collected information on participants’ blood alcohol level (BAC; percentage of alcohol in an individual’s blood stream) and age (in years).\nTo aid with interpretation, age was mean centered. The BAC measure was also transformed to represent a one-unit change as 0.01%, as opposed to 1%. Low-load was specified as the reference group of the perceptual load condition.\nDensity plots and bar plots will be used to individually visualise the associations between whether the mid-conversation swap was noticed and BAC, age, and condition.\nTo investigate whether the probability of noticing the swap differed as a function of age, BAC, and perceptual load, a binary logistic regression model was used, where the following model was specified:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ln \\left(\\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) ~=~ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Age + \\beta_2 \\cdot BAC + \\beta_3 \\cdot Condition_{High}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of noticing the mid-conversation swap}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nOur hypotheses are:\n\\(H_0:\\) All \\(\\beta_j = 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is not influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, or perceptual load.\n\\(H_1:\\) At least one \\(\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) (for \\(j = 1, 2, 3\\))\nSusceptibility to change blindness is influenced by age, level of alcohol intoxication, and/or perceptual load.\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\)."

What does this value mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\nHopefully you can see that the model predicted value for someone aged 30 is approximately 1.30.\nBut let’s pause to contemplate what this means, keeping in mind the way in which the ‘Notice’ variable was measured (i.e., no = 0, yes = 1).\nDoes this mean then that a 30 year old participant will… Notice 1.30 experimenter-swaps? Have a 130% probability of noticing the swap?\nNeither of these interpretations are quite right - participants could only notice one swap, and probability is between 0 and 1.\nTherefore, it seems that we cannot capture this as a linear relationship - we instead need a logistic regression model."

See Table 2 for full model results, and Figure 5 for a visualisation of the model estimates and confidence intervals.\nAge was found to be associated with susceptibility to change-blindness, where for every one year increase in age, the odds of a person noticing the mid-conversation swap decreased, with an \\(OR = 0.8\\) (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\, [0.73, 0.86]\\)), after accounting for differences in blood alcohol levels and perceptual load.\nIn contrary to what might have been expected, change-blindness appeared to decrease with higher alcohol intoxication, where for every 1/100th of a percentage increase in blood alcohol content, there were 1.42 times (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\,[1.15, 1.79]\\)) increased odds of noticing the swap when holding age and perceptual load constant.\nAfter accounting for age and blood alcohol levels, the odds of noticing the swap were significantly different depending upon the perceptual load. For those with a high perceptual load, the odds of noticing a swap decreased by a factor of 0.2 (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\,[0.07, 0.56]\\)).\nIn summary, older age increased the susceptibility to change blindness, high perceptual load was found to decrease the odds of people being blind to change, and increased levels of alcohol intoxication appeared to be associated with greater odds of noticing change."

For those who made no attempt to quit using tobacco products, the majority either had no intention of quitting or did not plan to quit in the near future."

Are there any additional plots you could check to determine if there are influential observations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause logistic regression models don’t have the same expected error distribution (we don’t expect residuals to be normally distributed around the mean, with constant variance), checking the assumptions of logistic regression is a little different.\n\n\nDeviance Residuals\nCook’s Distance\n\n\n\nTypically, we look at the “deviance residuals”. But we don’t examine plots for patterns, we simply examine them for potentially outlying observations. If we use a standardised residual, it makes it easier to explore extreme values as we expect most residuals to be within -2, 2 or -3, 3 (depending on how strict we feel).\n\n\nTo check for influential observations, we can use cooks.distance(), and plot this using plot(). Alternatively, you can specify which = 4 when plotting your fitted model (i.e., plot(model, which = ?).\nIn logistic regression, we can use the arbitrary cut-offs of 0.5 (moderately influential) or 1 (highly influential) to describe influential points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\n\nDeviance Residuals\nCook’s Distance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot of standardised deviance residuals above, there appears to be 1 residual with a value &gt;|2|, but none with a value &gt;|3|.

Our model with with intentions included as a predictor \\((AIC = 76.66)\\) was better fitting than the null model \\((AIC = 82.65)\\). However, the BIC values suggested that the model including intentions \\((BIC = 85.17)\\) was a poorer fit than the null \\((BIC = 84.77)\\). Based on the weight of evidence from both the Deviance goodness-of-fit test alongside the AIC and BIC values, we would conclude that the model with intentions was better fitting than the null."

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\nMischel, W., Ebbesen, E. B., & Raskoff Zeiss, A. (1972). Cognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21(2), 204–218. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198\nIn the current study, a sample of 304 children, ranging in ages from 3 to 10 years old, took part. Each child was shown a marshmallow, and it was explained that they were about to be left alone for 10 minutes. They were told that they were welcome to eat the marshmallow while they were waiting, but if the marshmallow was still there after 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows.\nFor half of the children who took part, the marshmallow was visible for the entire 10 minutes (or until they ate it!). For the other half, the marshmallow was placed under a plastic cup.\nThe experiment took part at various times throughout the working day, and researchers were worried about children being more hungry at certain times of day, so they kept track of whether each child completed the task in the morning or the afternoon, so that they could control for this in their analyses.\nFor an example of the marshmallow experiment, watch the following video:\n\n\n\n\n\nData Dictionary\nThe data in mallow2.csv contain five attributes collected from a simulated sample of \\(n=340\\) hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\n      Description\n    \n\n\nname\nParticipant name\n\n\nagemonths\nAge (in months)\n\n\ntimeofday\nTime of day that the experiment took place ('am' = morning, 'pm' = afternoon)\n\n\nvisibility\nExperimental condition - whether the marshmallow was 'visible' or 'hidden' for the 10 minutes\n\n\ntaken\nWhether or not the participant took ('taken') the marshmallow within the 10 minutes or left it ('waited')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n      agemonths\n      timeofday\n      visibility\n      taken\n    \n\n\nLauren\n60\npm\nvisible\ntaken\n\n\nTaraleah\n100\npm\nvisible\nwaited\n\n\nConnor\n109\npm\nvisible\nwaited\n\n\nSiengthong\n61\npm\nhidden\nwaited\n\n\nNaseem\n90\npm\nhidden\nwaited\n\n\nMartin\n636\nam\nhidden\ntaken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\nSetup\n\n\n\nCreate a new RMarkdown file\nLoad the required package(s)\nRead the mallow2 dataset into R, assigning it to an object named marshmallow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Solution \n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(psych) \nlibrary(sjPlot)\n\n#read in data\nmarshmallow &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Code\nTry to answer the research question above without referring to the provided analysis code below, and then check how your script matches up - is there anything you missed or done differently?

Remember, your analysis strategy should not contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:\n\nVery brief data and design description:\n\nGive the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\nSpecify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n\nData management:\n\nDescribe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\nAre there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many?\nDescribe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\nModel specification:\n\nClearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\nWhat type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\nIn some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification.\nSpecify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data.\nSpecify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these.\n\n\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see Lesson 4 of the Rmd Bootcamp.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\n\n\nThe mallow2 dataset contained information on 304 participants who took part in a study concerning delayed gratification (scored dichotomously as taken or waited) - where children were presented with a single marshmallow, but were told that if they could leave it for 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows. The children participated in either the morning (am) or afternoon (pm), and the marshmallow was either visible or hidden for the 10 minute duration of the experiment. The age of each child was also recorded. The sample of children also had their age recorded. All participant data was complete (no missing values).\nTo investigate whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day (AM/PM), age, and marshmallow visibility (visible/hidden), a binary logistic regression model was used. Effects were considered statistically significant at \\(\\alpha = .05\\). The following model specification was used:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Time of day}_{PM} +  \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Visibility}_{Hidden}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of taking the marshmallow}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTo address the research question of whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility, this formally corresponded to:\n\\[\nH_0: \\text{All} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ = ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n\\]\n\\[\nH_1: \\text{At least one} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ = ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n\\]\nTo assess model fit, we visually assessed the standardized deviance residuals and Cook’s Distance. We expected the former to identify outliers (or extreme values), and we expected residuals to fall within the range of -2 to 2. We used the latter to check for influential observations, and visually assessed if any of our 302 observations had a Cook’s distance &gt; than 0.5 (moderately influential) or &gt; 1 (highly influential).\n\n\n\nAct II: Results\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics).\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You don’t want to overload the reader with unnecessary or duplicate information, and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can.\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Results Section\n\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive Statistics\n\nvisibility\nM_Age\nSD_Age\npercent_pm\npercent_taken\n\n\n\nvisible\n6.60\n1.82\n50.67\n56.00\n\n\nhidden\n6.53\n1.92\n53.64\n33.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appeared that there those without senility symptoms present had higher WAIS scores than those with symptoms (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Association between Delayed Gratification, Age, Visibility of Marshmallow, and Time of Day\n\n\n\nA binary logistic regression model was fitted to determine whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility.\nOur model did not raise any concerns regarding fit. Though there appeared to be a few residuals with a value slightly larger than 2 in absolute value (see left-hand plot in Figure 2), they were not influential points (see right-hand plot in Figure 2), since none of our observations had a Cook’s distance value &gt; 0.5.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Model Fit Plots\n\n\n\nWAIS scores were a significant predictor of whether or not individuals experienced senility symptoms (see Table 2), where for every additional point scored on the WAIS, the odds of having senility symptoms decreased by a factor of 0.61 (\\(95\\%\\, CI\\, [0.34, 1.08]\\)).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\n\n\n \nMarshmallow Taken\n\n\nPredictors\nOdds Ratios\nCI\np\n\n\nIntercept\n81.93\n22.47 – 332.30\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nTime of Day - PM\n0.61\n0.34 – 1.08\n0.096\n\n\nAge (in years)\n0.56\n0.47 – 0.66\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nVisibility - Hidden\n0.30\n0.17 – 0.51\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n301\n\n\nR2 Tjur\n0.233\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualised the predicted probability based on our model estimates (see ?@fig-sen-out), which suggested that higher WAIS scores were associated with a lower probability of endorsing senility symptoms.\n\n\n$timeofday\n\n\n\n$age\n\n\n\n$visibility\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Model Results\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Model Results\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Model Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAct III: Discussion\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion - What To Include\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question.\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n\n\n\n Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\n\n\nOur results led us to reject the null hypothesis, as the direction of the association was clear from the results of our binary logistic regression model - lower WAIS scores increased the odds of endorsing senility symptoms. In conclusion, the presence of senility symptoms varied as a function of WAIS score."

To view solutions, click the drop down ‘Solution’ button.\nImportant  Before checking the solution you should attempt the question. You should also avoid copying and pasting code from the solutions. If you do check solutions right away and simply copy the answer, you will struggle to learn from the exercises.\nInstead, you should:\n\nTry to figure out the answer yourself or with your peers (and/or ask for help from a staff member if needed)\nType the code out yourself (and annotate your R code chunks so you know what your code is doing & why - future you will thank you for this).\n\n\n\n\nAsking Questions\n\nDuring labs, if you have a question, please ask one of the tutors for support.\nOutside of labs, we encourage you to use the various support options, details of which can be found on the Course Learn Page."

    "text": "Tips on Googling Statistics and R\nSearching online for help with statistics and R can be both a help and a hindrance. If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into Google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"
