# Week's Learning Objectives
1. Understand the key principles of least squares. 

2. Be able to interpret the coefficients from a simple linear model.

3. Understand how these interpretations change when we add more predictors


---
# Principle of least squares

+ The numbers `\(\beta_0\)` and `\(\beta_1\)` are typically **unknown** and need to be estimated in order to fit a line through the point cloud.

+ We denote the "best" values as `\(\hat \beta_0\)` and `\(\hat \beta_1\)`

+ The best fitting line is found using **least squares**
    + Minimizes the distances between the actual values of `\(y\)` and the model-predicted values of `\(\hat y\)`
    + Specifically minimizes the sum of the *squared* deviations

---
# Principle of least squares

+ Actual value = `\(y_i\)`

+ Model-predicted value = `\(\hat y_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i\)`

+ Deviation or residual = `\(y_i - \hat y_i\)`

+ Minimize the **residual sum of squares**, `\(SS_{Residual}\)`, which is

`$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} [y_i - (\hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_{i})]^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$`

---
# Principle of least squares

+ **Why do you think we square the deviations? **

    + HINT: Look back to the "What is `\(\epsilon_i\)`?" slide
    
--

+ We have positive and negative residual terms

+ If we simply added them, they would cancel out.

---
# Data, predicted values and residuals

+ Data = `\(y_i\)`
    + This is what we have measured in our study. 
    + For us, the test scores.

+ Predicted value = `\(\hat{y}_i = \hat \beta_0 + \hat \beta_1 x_i\)` = the y-value on the line at specific values of `\(x\)`
    + Or, the value of the outcome our model predicts given someone's values for predictors.
    + In our example, given you study for 4 hrs, what test score does our model predict you will get.

+ Residual = Difference between `\(y_i\)` and `\(\hat{y}_i\)`. So;

`$$SS_{Residual} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$`

???
+ these are important distinctions for understanding linear models
+ return to them a lot.

---
# Fitting the line
+ Calculations for slope:

`$$\hat \beta_1 = \frac{SP_{xy}}{SS_x}$$`


+ `\(SP_{xy}\)` = sum of cross-products:


`$$SP_{xy} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$$`


+ `\(SS_x\)` = sums of squared deviations of `\(x\)`:


`$$SS_x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2$$`


&lt;!-- --- --&gt;
&lt;!-- # Equivalent formula --&gt;

&lt;!-- $$\hat \beta_1 =  --&gt;
&lt;!-- \frac{SP_{xy}}{SS_x} =  --&gt;
&lt;!-- r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$$ --&gt;

&lt;!-- where --&gt;

&lt;!-- - `\(r = \frac{SP_{xy}}{\sqrt{SS_x \times SS_y}}\)` --&gt;

&lt;!-- - `\(s_y = \sqrt{ \frac{SS_y}{n - 1} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n - 1} }\)` --&gt;

&lt;!-- - `\(s_x = \sqrt{ \frac{SS_x}{n - 1} } = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1} }\)` --&gt;


---
# Fitting the line
+ Calculations for intercept:

`$$\hat \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \hat \beta_1 \bar{x}$$`

+ `\(\hat \beta_1\)` = slope estimate

+ `\(\bar{y}\)` = mean of `\(y\)`

+ `\(\bar{x}\)` = mean of `\(x\)`

Here we show these calculations for our example.

# Welcome Back!

**Where we left off... **

Calculated the intercept and slope

Now let's think about error...

---
# What is `\(\sigma\)`?



.pull-left[
&lt;center&gt;**Small `\(\sigma\)`**&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;img src="dapr2_02_LM2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.pull-right[
&lt;center&gt;**Large `\(\sigma\)`**&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;img src="dapr2_02_LM2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

---
# What is `\(\sigma\)`?

+ The less scatter around the line, the smaller the standard deviation of the errors

+ The less scatter around the line, the stronger the relationship between `\(y\)` and `\(x\)`. 

--

+ We estimate `\(\sigma\)` using the residuals

+ The estimated standard deviation of the errors is:
`$$\hat \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - k - 1}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat y_i)^2}{n - k - 1}}$$`

+ In simple linear regression we only have one `\(x\)`, so `\(k = 1\)` and the denominator becomes `\(n - 2\)`.


---
# Recap linear model
+ The linear model for a single predictor is written as:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ `\(\beta_0\)` = **Intercept**: the point where the line cross `\(y\)`, and `\(x\)` = 0

+ `\(\beta_1\)` = **Slope**: the gradient of the line, or rate of change

+ In our worked example we saw how to calculate the intercept and slope from the raw data.


---
# `lm` in R
+ We do not generally calculate by hand like this, so we also briefly introduced the `lm()` function.




```r
lm(score ~ hours, data = test)
```

```
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = score ~ hours, data = test)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)        hours  
##       0.400        1.055
```

---
# Interpretation

+ **Slope is the number of units by which Y increases, on average, for a unit increase in X.**

--
    + Unit of Y = 1 point on the test
    + Unit of X = 1 hour of study
    
--

+ So, for every hour of study, test score increases on average by 1.055 points.

--

+ **Intercept is the expected value of Y when X is 0.**

--

    + X = 0 is a student who does not study.

--

+ So, a student who does no study would be expected to score 0.40 on the test.

???
+ So we know in a general sense what the intercept and slope are, but what do they mean with respect to our data and question?

---
# Note of caution on intercepts
+ In our example, 0 has a meaning.
    + It is a student who has studied for 0 hours.
    
+ But it is not always the case that 0 is meaningful.

+ Suppose our predictor variable was not hours of study, but age.

+ **Look back at the interpretation of the intercept, and instead of hours of study, insert age. Read this aloud a couple of times.**

--

+ This is the first instance of a very general lesson about interpreting statistical tests. 
    + The interpretation is always in the context of the constructs and how we have measured them.

# Time for a break

#  Multiple regression 
+ The aim of a linear model is to explain variance in an outcome

+ In simple linear models, we have a single predictor, but the model can accommodate (in principle) any number of predictors. 

+ However, when we include multiple predictors, those predictors are likely to correlate

+ Thus, a linear model with multiple predictors finds the optimal prediction of the outcome from several predictors, **taking into account their redundancy with one another**


---
#  Uses of multiple regression 
+ **For prediction:** multiple predictors may lead to improved prediction. 

+ **For theory testing:** often our theories suggest that multiple variables together contribute to variation in an outcome

+ **For covariate control:** we might want to assess the effect of a specific predictor, controlling for the influence of others.
	+ E.g., effects of personality on health after removing the effects of age and sex


---
#  Extending the regression model 

+ Our model for a single predictor:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \epsilon_i$$` 

+ is extended to include additional `\(x\)`'s:

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_3 x_{3i} + \epsilon_i$$`  

+ For each `\(x\)`, we have an additional `\(b\)`
  + `\(\beta_1\)` is the coefficient for the 1st predictor
  + `\(\beta_2\)` for the second etc.


---
#  Interpreting coefficients in multiple regression 

`$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \beta_j x_{ji} + \epsilon_i$$`

+ Given that we have additional variables, our interpretation of the regression coefficients changes a little

+ `\(\beta_0\)` = the predicted value for `\(y\)` **all** `\(x\)` are 0.
	
+ Each `\(\beta_j\)` is now a **partial regression coefficient**
	+ It captures the change in `\(y\)` for a one unit change in , `\(x\)` **when all other x's are held constant**

+ What does holding constant mean? 
  + Refers to finding the effect of the predictor when the values of the other predictors are fixed
		+ It may also be expressed as the effect of **controlling for**, or **partialling out**, or **residualizing for** the other `\(x\)`'s

+ With multiple predictors `lm` isolates the effects and estimates the unique contributions of predictors.

.pull-right[

]

???
+ In simple linear models, we could visualise the model as a straight line in 2D space
	+ Least squares finds the coefficients that produces the *regression line* that minimises the vertical distances of the observed y-values from the line

+ In a regression with  2 predictors, this becomes a regression plane in 3D space
	+ The goal now becomes finding the set of coefficients that minimises the vertical distances between the *regression*  *plane* and the observed y-values

+ The logic extends to any number of predictors
	+ (but becomes very difficult to visualise!)

---
#  Example: lm with 2 predictors 

+ Imagine we were interested in examining predictors of school performance.  

+ we get a teacher rating of child's performance, a self-report measure of self control, and also measure teacher rated class interaction. 

+ We collect data on a sample of n=650 12 year old and fit a linear model.

+ We'll fit the model to `\(z\)`-scores for all variables. 
  + Remember `\(z\)`-scores have a mean of 0, and a SD of 1
  + So "1 unit" of a `\(z\)`-score is 1 SD
