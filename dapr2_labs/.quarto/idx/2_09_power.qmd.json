Participants were aged 18-75 years old, and were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (exciting - 1-hour long roller-coaster session; or relaxing - 1-hour long meditation session) before completing a free-recall test (% correct). \n\n:::\n\nNext, data checks & management: \n\n```{r}\n#look at structure of data:\nstr(recdata)\n\n#check for NAs - there are none - all FALSE:\ntable(is.na(recdata))\n\n#Group should be a factor:\nrecdata$group <- factor(recdata$group, \n                        levels = c(0, 1), \n                        labels = c('rollercoaster', 'meditation'))\n\n```\n\n\n:::{.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nThe 'group' variable denoting which intervention type participants were allocated to was coded as a factor with two levels - 'rollercoaster' and 'meditation', where 'rollercoaster' was designated as the reference group. There were no `NAs` contained within the dataset, and recall scores were within range (i.e., within possible values of 0-100), as were ages (i.e., all ages ranged from 18-75). \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Descriptive Statistics & Visualisations\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nProvide a table of descriptive statistics and visualise your data.\n\nRemember to interpret your plot in the context of the study. \n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\n1. For your table of descriptive statistics, both the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions will come in handy here.\n2.
