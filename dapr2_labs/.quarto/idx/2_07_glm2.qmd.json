Although their original sample size was large ($n$ = 1324), they were interested in running separate logistic regression analyses within subgroups. Most of the sample used only cigarettes. One of the smaller subgroups contained subjects who used both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products ($n$=61). For this problem, we focus on this smaller subgroup of dual cigarette and smokeless tobacco users.\n\n__Data Dictionary__\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nsmoke <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/QuitAttempts.csv\")\ntibble(\nvariable = names(smoke),\ndescription = c(\"Subject\",\"Quit Attempt - Whether the subject made an attempt to quit using tobacco products (0 = no attempt to quit; 1 = attempted to quit).\", \"Intention to Quit - Individuals intention to quit (1 = Never intend to quit; 2 = May intend to quit but not in the next 6 months; 3 = Intend to quit in the next 6 months; 4 = Intend to quit in the next 30 days)\")\n) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/QuitAttempts.csv') %>% head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\n1.

For your table of descriptive statistics, since we have two categorical variables, the `select()` and `table()` functions will come in handy here.\n2. Recall that when visualising a continuous outcome across several groups, `geom_boxplot()` may be most appropriate to use.\n3. For your visualisations, you will need to specify `as_factor()` when plotting the `Quit_Attempt` variable since this is numeric, but we want it to be treated as a factor **only** for plotting purposes\n4. Make sure to comment on any observed differences among the sample means of the four treatment conditions.\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric\n\nLet's first produce a descriptive statistics table:\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| label: tbl-cog-descript\n#| tbl-cap: Descriptive Statistics\nsmoke_stats <- smoke %>%\n    select(Intention, Quit_Attempt) %>%\n    table() %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Descriptive Statistics\") %>%\n    kable_styling()\n\nsmoke_stats\n```\n\nOr alternatively we could view as proportions: \n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| label: tbl-cog-prop\n#| tbl-cap: Proportions\nsmoke_prop <- smoke %>%\n  group_by(Intention, Quit_Attempt) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n()) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Prop = round(n/sum(n),2)\n  ) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Proportions\") %>%\n    kable_styling()\n\nsmoke_prop \n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nBased on the proportions presented in @tbl-cog-prop, we can see for those who had some intention to quit (i.e., maybe - not in next 6 months, yes - within next 6 months, or yes - within 30 days), there was a larger proportion of individuals who attempted to quit using tobacco products. \n\n:::\n\n## Visual\n\nWe can visually explore the association between the two categorical variables as follows:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-smoke-desc\n#| fig-cap: \"Association between Intention and Quitting Attempt\"\nsmoke_plt1 <- ggplot(data = smoke, aes(x=as_factor(Quit_Attempt), fill=Intention)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(fill = 'Intention to Quit', x = \"Attempted Quitting (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\")\nsmoke_plt1\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nFrom @fig-smoke-desc, we can see that for those who made an attempt to quit using tobacco products, the majority intended to quit - either in the immediate or distant future.

Are there any additional plots you could check to determine if there are influential observations?\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\n*Deviance Residuals* \n\nBecause logistic regression models don't have the same expected error distribution (we don't expect residuals to be normally distributed around the mean, with constant variance), checking the assumptions of logistic regression is a little different.  \n\nTypically, we look at the \"deviance residuals\". But we __don't__ examine plots for patterns, we simply examine them for potentially outlying observations. If we use a standardised residual, it makes it easier to explore extreme values as we expect most residuals to be within -2, 2 or -3, 3 (depending on how strict we feel).  \n\n*Cook's Distance*\n\nTo check for influential observations, we can use `cooks.distance()`, and plot this using `plot()`. Alternatively, you can specify `which = 4` when plotting your fitted model. In logistic regression, we can use the arbitrary cut-offs of 0.5 (moderately influential) or 1 (highly influential) to describe influential points. \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIn the plot above, there appears to be 1 residual with a value >|2|, but none with a value >|3|. We will keep this in mind and check if they are also an influential point by plotting Cook's Distance:\n\n```{r}\n#cooks d - option 1 (only need to use one of these two options)\nplot(cooks.distance(smoke_mdl1), ylab = \"Cook's Distance\")\n\n#cooks d - option 2 (only need to use one of these two options)\nplot(smoke_mdl1, which = 4)\n```\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be any influential observations based on our Cook's distance plot, since all values < .50.\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(6)`\n\nPerform a Deviance goodness-of-fit test to compare your fitted model to the null. \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_0 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 \\\\\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Intention2 + \\beta_2 Intention3 + \\beta_3 Intention4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nReport which model you think best fits the data.\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint \n\nConsider whether or not your models are nested. The flowchart in [Question 10 of the Semester 2 Week 1 lab](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2223/labs/2_01_model_comps.html) may be helpful to revisit. \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFirst, let's fit the null model:\n\n```{r}\nsmoke_mdl0 <- glm(Quit_Attempt ~ 1, data = smoke, family = \"binomial\")\nsummary(smoke_mdl0)\n```\n\nSince our models are nested, we can compare using the likelihood ratio test:\n\n```{r}\nanova(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1, test = 'Chisq')\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nAt the 5% significance level, the addition of information about the participants’ intention to quit resulted in a significant decrease in model deviance $\\chi^2(3) = 11.99, p = .007$.\n\nHence, we have strong evidence that the model the subjects’ intention to quit is a helpful predictor of whether or not they will attempt quitting in the future.\n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(7)`\n\nCheck the AIC and BIC values for smoke_mdl0 and smoke_mdl1 - which model should we prefer?\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#AIC\nAIC(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1)\n\n#BIC\nBIC(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nWe used AIC and BIC model selection to distinguish between two possible models describing the association between attempting to quit and intentions. Our model with with intentions included as a predictor (AIC = 76.66) was better fitting than the null model (AIC = 82.65). However, the BIC values suggested that the model including intentions (BIC = 85.17) was a poorer fit than the null (BIC = 84.77). Based on the weight of evidence from both the Deviance goodness-of-fit test alongside the AIC and BIC values, we would conclude that the model with intentions was better fitting than the null.\n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Visualise Model\n\n`r qbegin(8)`\n\nPlot the following:\n\n+ predicted model estimates\n+ predicted probability\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\nHere you will need to use `plot_model()` from the **sjPlot** package.

For your table of descriptive statistics, since we have two categorical variables, the `select()` and `table()` functions will come in handy here.\n2. Recall that when visualising a continuous outcome across several groups, `geom_boxplot()` may be most appropriate to use.\n3. For your visualisations, you will need to specify `as_factor()` when plotting the `Quit_Attempt` variable since this is numeric, but we want it to be treated as a factor **only** for plotting purposes\n4. Make sure to comment on any observed differences among the sample means of the four treatment conditions.\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric\n\nLet's first produce a descriptive statistics table:\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| label: tbl-cog-descript\n#| tbl-cap: Descriptive Statistics\nsmoke_stats <- smoke %>%\n    select(Intention, Quit_Attempt) %>%\n    table() %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Descriptive Statistics\") %>%\n    kable_styling()\n\nsmoke_stats\n```\n\nOr alternatively we could view as proportions: \n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| label: tbl-cog-prop\n#| tbl-cap: Proportions\nsmoke_prop <- smoke %>%\n  group_by(Intention, Quit_Attempt) %>%\n  summarise(\n    n = n()) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Prop = round(n/sum(n),2)\n  ) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Proportions\") %>%\n    kable_styling()\n\nsmoke_prop \n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nBased on the proportions presented in @tbl-cog-prop, we can see for those who had some intention to quit (i.e., maybe - not in next 6 months, yes - within next 6 months, or yes - within 30 days), there was a larger proportion of individuals who attempted to quit using tobacco products. \n\n:::\n\n## Visual\n\nWe can visually explore the association between the two categorical variables as follows:\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-smoke-desc\n#| fig-cap: \"Association between Intention and Quitting Attempt\"\nsmoke_plt1 <- ggplot(data = smoke, aes(x=as_factor(Quit_Attempt), fill=Intention)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(fill = 'Intention to Quit', x = \"Attempted Quitting (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\")\nsmoke_plt1\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nFrom @fig-smoke-desc, we can see that for those who made an attempt to quit using tobacco products, the majority intended to quit - either in the immediate or distant future.

Are there any additional plots you could check to determine if there are influential observations?\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\n*Deviance Residuals* \n\nBecause logistic regression models don't have the same expected error distribution (we don't expect residuals to be normally distributed around the mean, with constant variance), checking the assumptions of logistic regression is a little different.  \n\nTypically, we look at the \"deviance residuals\". But we __don't__ examine plots for patterns, we simply examine them for potentially outlying observations. If we use a standardised residual, it makes it easier to explore extreme values as we expect most residuals to be within -2, 2 or -3, 3 (depending on how strict we feel).  \n\n*Cook's Distance*\n\nTo check for influential observations, we can use `cooks.distance()`, and plot this using `plot()`. Alternatively, you can specify `which = 4` when plotting your fitted model. In logistic regression, we can use the arbitrary cut-offs of 0.5 (moderately influential) or 1 (highly influential) to describe influential points. \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIn the plot above, there appears to be 1 residual with a value >|2|, but none with a value >|3|. We will keep this in mind and check if they are also an influential point by plotting Cook's Distance:\n\n```{r}\n#cooks d - option 1 (only need to use one of these two options)\nplot(cooks.distance(smoke_mdl1), ylab = \"Cook's Distance\")\n\n#cooks d - option 2 (only need to use one of these two options)\nplot(smoke_mdl1, which = 4)\n```\n\nThere doesn’t appear to be any influential observations based on our Cook's distance plot, since all values < .50.\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(6)`\n\nPerform a Deviance goodness-of-fit test to compare your fitted model to the null. \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_0 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 \\\\\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Intention2 + \\beta_2 Intention3 + \\beta_3 Intention4\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nReport which model you think best fits the data.\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint \n\nConsider whether or not your models are nested. The flowchart in [Question 10 of the Semester 2 Week 1 lab](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2223/labs/2_01_model_comps.html) may be helpful to revisit. \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFirst, let's fit the null model:\n\n```{r}\nsmoke_mdl0 <- glm(Quit_Attempt ~ 1, data = smoke, family = \"binomial\")\nsummary(smoke_mdl0)\n```\n\nSince our models are nested, we can compare using the likelihood ratio test:\n\n```{r}\nanova(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1, test = 'Chisq')\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nAt the 5% significance level, the addition of information about the participants’ intention to quit resulted in a significant decrease in model deviance $\\chi^2(3) = 11.99, p = .007$.\n\nHence, we have strong evidence that the model the subjects’ intention to quit is a helpful predictor of whether or not they will attempt quitting in the future.\n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(7)`\n\nCheck the AIC and BIC values for smoke_mdl0 and smoke_mdl1 - which model should we prefer?\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#AIC\nAIC(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1)\n\n#BIC\nBIC(smoke_mdl0, smoke_mdl1)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nWe used AIC and BIC model selection to distinguish between two possible models describing the association between attempting to quit and intentions. Our model with with intentions included as a predictor (AIC = 76.66) was better fitting than the null model (AIC = 82.65). However, the BIC values suggested that the model including intentions (BIC = 85.17) was a poorer fit than the null (BIC = 84.77). Based on the weight of evidence from both the Deviance goodness-of-fit test alongside the AIC and BIC values, we would conclude that the model with intentions was better fitting than the null.\n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Visualise Model\n\n`r qbegin(8)`\n\nPlot the following:\n\n+ predicted model estimates\n+ predicted probability\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\nHere you will need to use `plot_model()` from the **sjPlot** package.
