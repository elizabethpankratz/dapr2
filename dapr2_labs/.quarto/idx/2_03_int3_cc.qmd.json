However, the task factor in such design would then be within-subjects, meaning that the scores corresponding to the same person would be correlated. To analyse such design we will need a different method which is discussed next year!]\n\nThe tasks chosen by the researchers have been picked to map onto the theoretical differences between the three types of research participants. The first task (grammar) is known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes. If the theory is correct, we would expect the difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks to be relatively similar for the control and amnesiac groups, but relatively larger for the Huntingtons group compared to controls.\n\n__Preview__\n\nThe first ten rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv') %>% head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n# Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\n1.
