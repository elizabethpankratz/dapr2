The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), was used to measure mental health and well-being. \n\nParticipants filled out a questionnaire including items concerning: estimated average number of hours spent outdoors each week, estimated average number of social interactions each week (whether on-line or in-person), whether a daily routine is followed (yes/no).
