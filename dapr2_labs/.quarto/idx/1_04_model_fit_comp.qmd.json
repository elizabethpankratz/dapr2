The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  \n\nThe researchers also asked participants to estimate the average number of hours they spend outdoors each week, the average number of social interactions they have each week (whether on-line or in-person), and whether they believe that they stick to a routine throughout the week (Yes/No).  \n\nThe data in `wellbeing.csv` contain five attributes collected from a random sample of $n=32$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:\n\n- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being.
