Be up to date with lectures\n2. Have completed Labs 1 - 4\n\n### <i class=\"fab fa-r-project\"></i> Required R Packages\nRemember to load all packages within a code chunk at the start of your RMarkdown file using `library()`. If you do not have a package and need to install, do so within the console using `install.packages(\" \")`. For further guidance on installing/updating packages, see Section C [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/files/install-update-r#update-pkgs). \n\nFor this lab, you will need to load the following package(s):\n\n* **tidyverse** \n* **patchwork**\n* **sjPlot**\n* **kableExtra**\n\n### <i class=\"fa fa-file\"></i> Lab Data\nYou can download the data required for this lab [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv) or read it in via this link https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv. \n:::\n\n# Section A: Write-Up\n\nIn this lab you will be presented with the output from a statistical analysis, and your job will be to write-up and present the results. We're going to use an example analysis using one of the datasets we have worked with on a number of exercises in previous labs concerning personality traits, social comparison, depression, and anxiety.  \n\nThe aim in writing should be that a reader is able to more or less replicate your analyses **without** referring to your R code. This requires detailing all of the steps you took in conducting the analysis.  \nThe point of using RMarkdown is that you can pull your results **directly** from the code. If your analysis changes, so does your report!  \n\nMake sure that your final report doesn't show any R functions or code. Remember you are interpreting and reporting your results in text, tables, or plots, targeting a generic reader who may use different software or may not know R at all. If you need a reminder on how to hide code, format tables, etc., make sure to review the [rmd bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io//rmd-bootcamp/).\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n## Important - Write-Up Examples & Plagiarism\n\nThe example write-up sections included below are not **perfect** - they instead should give you a good example of what information you should include within each section, and how to structure this. For example, some information is missing (e.g., interpretation of descriptive statistics, what type of interaction is present), some information could be presented more clearly (e.g., variable names in tables, table/figure titles/captions, and rationales for choices), and writing could be more concise in places (e.g., discussion section is quite long).  \n\nFurther, **you must not copy any of the write-up included below for future reports** - if you do, you will be committing plagiarism, and this type of academic misconduct is taken very seriously by the University. You can find out more [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/conduct/academic-misconduct).\n\n:::\n\n## Study Overview \n\n> **Research Question**\n> \n> Does education level explain a significant amount of variance in income over seniority?\n\nLet’s imagine a study into income disparity for workers in the city of Riverview, a a hypothetical midwestern city in the US.. We might carry out interviews and find that there is an association between the level of education and an employee’s income.

Remember, your analysis strategy should **not** contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:  \n\n-  Very brief data and design description:\n     - Give the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\n     - Specify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (for Likert scales), and how they are scored.\n\n-  Data management:  \n     - Describe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\n     - Are there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many? \n     - \\* Describe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n-  Model specification:  \n     -  Clearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\n     -  What type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\n     - In some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification. \n     -  Specify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s).\n\n:::frame\n*** This is not yet a completed list -- we will add more to this as we progress through the course (e.g., coding of categorical variables, checking assumptions, diagnostics, etc.)\n:::\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see [Lesson 4 of the Rmd Bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io//rmd-bootcamp/).\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n#### Act II: Results\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Results - What To Include***\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy. \n\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You don't want to overload the reader with unnecessary information, and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can.\n\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of an exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n:::frame\n*** This is not yet a completed list -- we will add more to this as we progress through the course (e.g., evaluation of diagnostic plots, etc.)\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Results Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n\n#### Act III: Discussion\n\n`r qbegin(3)`\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Discussion - What To Include\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question. \n\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n# Section B: Weeks 1 - 4 Recap\n\nIn the second part of the lab, there is no new content - the purpose of the recap section is for you to revisit and revise the concepts you have learned over the last 4 weeks. \n\n:::red\n\nBefore you expand each of the boxes below, think about how comfortable you feel with each concept.  \n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Types of Models: Deterministic vs Statistical\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n#### __Deterministic (*Example: Perimeter & Side*)__\n\nThe mathematical model \n\n$$\nPerimeter = 4 * Side\n$$ \n\nor, equivalently, \n$$\ny = 4 * x\n$$\n\nrepresents the relationship between side and perimeter of squares. This is an example of a _deterministic model_ as it is a model of an *exact relationship* - there can be no deviation.\n\n#### __Statistical (*Example: Height & Handspan*)__\n\nThe relationship between height and handspan shows deviations from the 'average pattern'. Hence, we need to create a model that allows for deviations from the linear relationship - we need a _statistical model_.\n\nA statistical model includes *both* a deterministic function and a random error term:\n$$\nHandspan = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * Height + \\epsilon\n$$\nor, in short,\n$$\ny = \\underbrace{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x}_{\\text{function of }x} + \\underbrace{\\epsilon}_{\\text{random error}}\n$$\n\nThe deterministic function need not be linear if the scatterplot displays signs of nonlinearity.\n\nIn the equation above, the terms $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ are numbers specifying where the line going through the data meets the y-axis and its slope (direction and gradient of line).\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nSee Week 1 [lab](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2223/labs/1_01_function.html) and both [lecture 1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2223/lectures/dapR2_00_Intro.html) and [lecture 2](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2223/lectures/dapr2_01_introlm.html) for further details and to revise these concepts further.\n\n:::\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n`r optbegin(\"Null & Alternative Hypotheses\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nRecall that statistical hypotheses are testable mathematical statements.\n\nWe need to define a null ($H_0$) and alternative ($H_1$) hypothesis.\n\nPoints to note:\n\n- We can only ever test the null ($H_0$), so all statements must be made in reference to this\n- We can only ever reject or fail to reject the null (we can **never** accept a hypothesis)\n\n`r optend()`\n\n`r optbegin(\"Simple Linear Regression\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Formula:**  \n\n$$\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\n$$\nIn **R**:\n\n:::blue\n\nThere are basically two pieces of information that we need to pass to the `lm()` function:\n\n1.

For example, some information is missing (e.g., interpretation of descriptive statistics, what type of interaction is present), some information could be presented more clearly (e.g., variable names in tables, table/figure titles/captions, and rationales for choices), and writing could be more concise in places (e.g., discussion section is quite long).  \n\nFurther, **you must not copy any of the write-up included below for future reports** - if you do, you will be committing plagiarism, and this type of academic misconduct is taken very seriously by the University. You can find out more [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/conduct/academic-misconduct).\n\n:::\n\n## Study Overview \n\n> **Research Question**\n> \n> Does education level explain a significant amount of variance in income over seniority?\n\nLet’s imagine a study into income disparity for workers in the city of Riverview, a a hypothetical midwestern city in the US.. We might carry out interviews and find that there is an association between the level of education and an employee’s income.

Remember, your analysis strategy should **not** contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:  \n\n-  Very brief data and design description:\n     - Give the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\n     - Specify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (for Likert scales), and how they are scored.\n\n-  Data management:  \n     - Describe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\n     - Are there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many? \n     - \\* Describe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n-  Model specification:  \n     -  Clearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\n     -  What type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\n     - In some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification. \n     -  Specify the model(s) to be fitted to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s).\n\n:::frame\n*** This is not yet a completed list -- we will add more to this as we progress through the course (e.g., coding of categorical variables, checking assumptions, diagnostics, etc.)\n:::\n\nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see [Lesson 4 of the Rmd Bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io//rmd-bootcamp/).\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n#### Act II: Results\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Results - What To Include***\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy. \n\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You don't want to overload the reader with unnecessary information, and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can.\n\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of an exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.\n\n:::frame\n*** This is not yet a completed list -- we will add more to this as we progress through the course (e.g., evaluation of diagnostic plots, etc.)\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Results Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n\n#### Act III: Discussion\n\n`r qbegin(3)`\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Discussion - What To Include\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question. \n\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n`r optend()`\n\n# Section B: Weeks 1 - 4 Recap\n\nIn the second part of the lab, there is no new content - the purpose of the recap section is for you to revisit and revise the concepts you have learned over the last 4 weeks. \n\n:::red\n\nBefore you expand each of the boxes below, think about how comfortable you feel with each concept.  \n\n:::\n\n`r optbegin(\"Types of Models: Deterministic vs Statistical\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n#### __Deterministic (*Example: Perimeter & Side*)__\n\nThe mathematical model \n\n$$\nPerimeter = 4 * Side\n$$ \n\nor, equivalently, \n$$\ny = 4 * x\n$$\n\nrepresents the relationship between side and perimeter of squares.
