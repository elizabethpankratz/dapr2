They want to assess whether the effect of social interactions on wellbeing _is moderated by_ (depends upon) whether or not a person lives in a rural area.  \n\n`r optbegin(\"Wellbeing/Rurality Codebook\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`  \n\n__Description__\n\nFrom the Edinburgh & Lothians, 100 city/suburb residences and 100 rural residences were chosen at random and contacted to participate in the study. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), was used to measure mental health and well-being. \n\nParticipants filled out a questionnaire including items concerning: estimated average number of hours spent outdoors each week, estimated average number of social interactions each week (whether on-line or in-person), whether a daily routine is followed (yes/no). For those respondents who had an activity tracker app or smart watch, they were asked to provide their average weekly number of steps.  \n  \n__Data Dictionary__\n\nThe data in `wellbeing_rural.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=200$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include: \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nmwdata  <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv\")\ntibble(\nvariable = names(mwdata),\ndescription = c(\"Age in years of respondent\",\"Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors \", \"Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)\", \"Binary 1=Yes/0=No response to the question 'Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?'\", \"Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being.

Using a between-subjects design, the researchers collected information on participants' wellbeing (measured via WEMWBS), outdoor time (hours per week), social interactions (number per week), routine (whether or not one was followed), location of residence (City, Suburb, or Rural), average weekly steps (in thousands), and age (in years).\n\nDensity plots and histograms will be used to visualise the marginal distributions of wellbeing and social interactions, and the strength of association between the two variables estimated via the correlation coefficient. To understand how these associations differ between rural and non-rural locations, scatterplots will be used. \n\nTo address the research question of whether the association between the number of social interactions and wellbeing differs between rural and non-rural residents, we are going to fit the following interaction model, where $y$ = wellbeing; $x_1$ = social interactions; and $x_2$ = whether or not the respondent lives in a rural location (where not rural will be specified as the reference group). \n\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1  x_1 + \\beta_2  x_2 + \\beta_3 (x_1 \\cdot x_2) + \\epsilon \\\\ \n\\quad \n\\\\ \n\\text{where} \\quad \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma) \\quad \\text{independently}\n$$\n\n<center>\n\n**OR**\n\n</center>\n\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Wellbeing} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot Social~Interactions + \\beta_2 \\cdot Location_{Rural} \\\\+ \\beta_3 \\cdot (Social~Interactions \\cdot Location_{Rural}) + \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at $\\alpha=.05$\n\nOur hypotheses are:\n\n$H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$\n\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is not moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area. \n\n$H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0$\n\nThe association between wellbeing and social interactions is moderated by whether or not a person lives in a rural area. \n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nCheck coding of variables (e.g., that categorical variables are coded as factors). \n\nNote that the \"location\" variable currently has three levels (Rural/Suburb/City). In order to address the research question, we only want two (Rural/Not Rural) locations - you will need to fix this.\n\nAs specified in Q1, we want 'not rural' as the reference group, so make sure to specify this.\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\nOne way to do this would be to use `ifelse()` to define a variable which takes one value (\"Rural\") if the observation meets from some condition, or another value (\"Not Rural\") if it does not. Type `?ifelse` in the *console* if you want to see the help function. You can use it to add a new variable either inside `mutate()`, or using `data$new_variable_name <- ifelse(test, x, y)` syntax.\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nCreate a new variable for Rural/Not Rural:\n```{r}\n#if location is rural, assign name 'rural'.

The `pairs.panels()` function from the `psych` package can plot all variables in a dataset against one another. This will save you the time you would have spent creating individual plots, but is only useful for *continuous* variables.  \n2. To include facets, within your `ggplot()` argument you will need to specify `+ facet_wrap()` in order to produce facets for each location. It would also be useful to specify `geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")`\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric\n\nFor a quick overview of several summary statistics at once for all columns of our dataframe, but separately for each level of location (i.e.,rural and non-rural), you can use `describeBy()` from the **psych** package (but note that this is *not an APA style table*):\n\n```{r}\ndescribeBy(mwdata, mwdata$isRural)\n```\n\nWe can present our summary statistics for wellbeing and social interactions grouped by location in a well formatted table using `kable()`: \n\n```{r}\n#| label: tbl-w1-desc\n#| tbl-cap: Wellbeing, Social Interactions, and Location Descriptive Statistics\nmwdata %>%\n    select(isRural, wellbeing, social_int) %>%\n    group_by(isRural) %>%\n    summarise(Wellbeing_M = mean(wellbeing),\n              Wellbeing_SD = sd(wellbeing),\n              SocialInt_M = mean(social_int),\n              SocialInt_SD = sd(social_int)) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Wellbeing, Social Interactions, and Location Descriptive Statistics\", align = \"c\", digits = 2, booktabs = TRUE) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Visual \n\nLet's first plot the continuous variables included within our model (note that we could use this for the whole dataset, but we don't want to include irrelevant- / non-continuous variables):\n\n```{r}\nmwdata %>% \n  select(wellbeing, social_int) %>%\n  pairs.panels()\n```\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nWellbeing and social interactions appear to follow unimodal distributions.

The slopes appear to be different for each location, where the greatest difference in wellbeing scores by location is most visible the highest number of social interactions. This suggests that there may be an interaction. \n\n::: \n\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### How do we know there might be an interaction? \n\nThe lines in the two plots above are not running in *parallel* - this suggests the presence of an interaction. Specifically in our example, the non-parallel lines suggest an interaction effect based on location, as the number of social interactions does not appear to have the same influence on rural and non-rural residents' wellbeing scores. However, the only way we can determine whether there is actually an interaction is by including an interaction term in our model, and testing this. \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Model Fitting & Interpretation \n\n`r qbegin(4)`\n\nFit your model using `lm()`, and assign it as an object with the name \"rural_mod\".   \n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\nWhen fitting a regression model in `R` with two explanatory variables A and B, and their interaction, these three are equivalent:  \n\n+ y ~ A + B + A:B\n+ y ~ A + B + A*B\n+ y ~ A*B  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#fit model including interaction between social_int and isRural\nrural_mod <- lm(wellbeing ~  social_int * isRural, data = mwdata)\n\n#check model output\nsummary(rural_mod)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(5)`  \n\nLook at the parameter estimates from your model, and write a description of what each one corresponds to on the plot shown in @fig-annotate-int (it may help to sketch out the plot yourself and annotate it).  \n\n```{r fig-annotate-int, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap=\"Multiple regression model: Wellbeing ~ Social Interactions * is Rural<br><small>Note that the dashed lines represent predicted values below the minimum observed number of social interactions, to ensure that zero on the x-axis is visible</small>\"}\n#| label: fig-annotate-int\n#| fig-cap: \"Multiple regression model: Wellbeing ~ Social Interactions * is Rural\"\nnd = expand_grid(social_int=0:13,isRural=c(\"rural\",\"not rural\"))\nnd = nd %>% mutate(wellbeing = predict(rural_mod, newdata = .))\nsjPlot::plot_model(rural_mod, type=\"int\")+\n  scale_fill_manual(NULL, values=c(NA,NA))+xlim(0,28)+\n  geom_line(inherit.aes=FALSE,data=nd,aes(x=social_int,col=isRural,y=wellbeing), lty=\"longdash\")+\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 1))\n```\n\n`r optbegin(\"Options\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nHere are some options to choose from:\n\n+ The point at which the red line cuts the y-axis (where social_int = 0)\n+ The point at which the blue line cuts the y-axis (where social_int = 0)\n+ The vertical distance from the red to the blue line _at the y-axis_ (where social_int = 0)\n+ The vertical distance from the blue to the red line _at the y-axis_ (where social_int = 0)\n+ The vertical distance from the blue to the red line _at the center of the plot_\n+ The vertical distance from the red to the blue line _at the center of the plot_\n+ The slope (vertical increase on the y-axis associated with a 1 unit increase on the x-axis) of the red line\n+ The slope (vertical increase on the y-axis associated with a 1 unit increase on the x-axis) of the blue line\n+ How the slope of the line changes when you move from the red to the blue line\n\n`r optend()`\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nRecall that we can obtain our parameter estimates using various functions such as `summary()`,`coef()`, `coefficients()`, etc. \n\n```{r}\ncoefficients(rural_mod)\n```\n\n+ $\\beta_0$ = `(Intercept)` = `r round(coef(rural_mod)[1],2)`\n    - On plot: The point at which the red line cuts the y-axis\n    - Interpretation: The intercept, or predicted wellbeing score when the number of social interactions per week is 0, and when location is not rural.\n\n+ $\\beta_1$ = `social_int` = `r round(coef(rural_mod)[2],2)`\n    - On plot: The slope (vertical increase on the y-axis associated with a 1 unit increase on the x-axis) of the red line.\n    - Interpretation: The simple slope of social interactions (number per week) for location reference group (not rural).\n\n+ $\\beta_2$ = `isRuralrural` = `r round(coef(rural_mod)[3],2)`\n    - On plot: The vertical distance from the red to the blue line _at the y-axis_ (where social_int = 0).  \n    - Interpretation: The simple effect of location (or the difference in wellbeing scores between rural and non rural residents) when number of social interactions is 0. \n\n+ $\\beta_3$ `social_int:isRuralrural` = `r round(coef(rural_mod)[4],2)`\n    - On plot: How the slope of the line differs when you move from the red to the blue line. \n    - Interpretation: The interaction between social interactions (number per week) and location (rural/not rural).
