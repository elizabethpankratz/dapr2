We might carry out interviews and find that there is an association between the level of education and an employee’s income. Those with more formal education seem to be better paid. \n\nIn this lab, we will use the riverview data (see below codebook) to examine whether education level is related to income among the employees working for the city of Riverview, a hypothetical midwestern city in the US.\n\n`r optbegin('Riverview data codebook.', FALSE, show = TRUE, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\n__Description__\n\nThe riverview data come from @Lewis-Beck2015 and contain five attributes collected from a random sample of employees working in the hypothetical city of Riverview ($n=32$). The attributes include:\n\n- `education`: Years of formal education\n- `income`: Annual income (in thousands of U.S. dollars)\n- `seniority`: Years of seniority\n- `gender`: Employee's gender\n- `male`: Dummy coded gender variable (0 = Female, 1 = Male)\n- `party`: Political party affiliation\n\n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nriverview <- read_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/riverview.csv')\nkable(head(riverview), align='c') %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Setup\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\n1.

It represents how much individual data points tend to deviate above and below the regression line. \n\nA small $\\sigma$ indicates that the points hug the line closely and we should expect fairly accurate predictions, while a large $\\sigma$ suggests that, even if we estimate the line perfectly, we can expect individual values to deviate from it by substantial amounts.\n\nThe *estimated* standard deviation of the errors is denoted $\\hat \\sigma$, and is estimated by essentially averaging squared residuals (giving the variance) and taking the square-root: \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\hat \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - k - 1}} \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\\\\n& SS_{Residual} = \\textrm{Sum of Squared Residuals} = \\sum_{i=1}^n{(\\epsilon_i)^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n`r optend()`\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe estimated standard deviation of the errors can be equivalently obtained by the below methods.

Hence, if we want predictions for new (unobserved) data, we first need to create a tibble with a column called `education` containing the years of education for which we want the prediction, and store this as a dataframe.\n\n\n```{r}\n#Create dataframe 'newdata' containing education years of 7, 11 and 25\nnewdata <- tibble(education = c(7, 11, 25))\nnewdata\n```\n\nThen we take `newdata` and add a new column called `income_hat`, computed as the prediction from the fitted `mdl` using the `newdata` above:\n\n```{r}\nnewdata <- newdata %>%\n  mutate(\n    income_hat = predict(mdl, newdata = newdata)\n  )\nnewdata\n```\n\n### Residuals\n\nThe residuals represent the deviations between the actual responses and the predicted responses and can be obtained either as\n\n- `mdl$residuals`\n- `resid(mdl)`\n- `residuals(mdl)`\n- computing them as the difference between the response ($y_i$) and the predicted response ($\\hat y_i$)\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n`r qbegin(9)`\n\nUse `predict(mdl)` to compute the fitted values and residuals.
