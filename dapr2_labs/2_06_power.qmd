# Study Overview {#sec-studyview} 

> **Research Question**
>
> Do age and intervention type influence recall?

`r optbegin("Recall codebook", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)` 

__Description__

A sample of 100 individuals aged 18-75 years old was randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups, and completed a free-recall test after their intervention. There were two types of intervention - exciting (1-hour long roller-coaster session; group = 0) or relaxing (1-hour long meditation session; group = 1). 

__Data Dictionary__

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
recdata <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/recall_med_coast.csv")
tibble(
variable = names(recdata),
description = c("The percentage of correctly recalled items","Denotes whether the individual was assigned to the roller-coaster (group = 0) or the meditation (group = 1) intervention condition", "Age (in years)")
) %>% gt::gt()
```

__Preview__

The first six rows of the data are:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Exercises 

## Study Overview & Data Management

`r qbegin(1)`

First, provide a brief overview of the study design and data.

Next examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

- Give the reader some background on the context of the study
- State what type of analysis you will conduct in order to address the research question
- Specify the model to be fitted to address the research question
- Specify your chosen significance ($\alpha$) level
- State your hypotheses

Much of the information required can be found in the [Study Overview] codebook.  

The [statistical models](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b3_reading.html#statistical-models) flashcards may also be useful to refer to. Specifically the [interaction models flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#interaction-models) and [numeric x categorical example flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b3_reading.html#numeric-x-categorical-example) might be of most use.

## Study design and data

The `recdata` dataset contained information on 100 hypothetical participants who participated in a between-subjects experiment exploring the associations among recall, age, and intervention type. Participants were aged 18-75 years old, and were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (exciting - 1-hour long roller-coaster session; or relaxing - 1-hour long meditation session) before completing a free-recall test (% correct). 


## Data checks & management

```{r}
#look at structure of data:
str(recdata)

#check for NAs - there are none - all FALSE:
table(is.na(recdata))

#Group should be a factor:
recdata$group <- factor(recdata$group, 
                        levels = c(0, 1), 
                        labels = c('rollercoaster', 'meditation'))

```


The 'group' variable denoting which intervention type participants were allocated to was coded as a factor with two levels - 'rollercoaster' and 'meditation', where 'rollercoaster' was designated as the reference group. There were no `NAs` contained within the dataset, and recall scores were within range (i.e., within possible values of 0-100), as were ages (i.e., all ages ranged from 18-75).

## Descriptive Statistics & Visualisations

`r qbegin(2)`

Provide a table of descriptive statistics and visualise your data.

Remember to interpret your findings in the context of the study. 

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the many ways to numerically and visually explore your data by reading over the [data exploration flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration).

For examples, see flashcards on [descriptives statistics tables - categorical and numeric values examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration) and [data visualisation - bivariate examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#visual-exploration), paying particular attention to the type of data that you're working with.

More specifically:    
1. For your table of descriptive statistics, both the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions will come in handy here.  
  
2. If you use the `select()` function and get an error along the lines of `Error in select...unused arguments...`, you will need to specify `dplyr::select()` (this just tells `R` which package to use the select function from).  

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Numeric

Descriptive statistics presented in a well formatted table:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-cog-descript
#| tbl-cap: Descriptive Statistics
recall_stats <- recdata %>%
    group_by(group) %>%
    summarise(
       n = n(),
       M_Age = mean(age),
       SD_Age = sd(age),
       M_Recall = mean(perc_recall)
       ) %>%
    kable(caption = "Descriptive Statistics", digits = 2) %>%
    kable_styling()

recall_stats
```


## Visual

We can visually explore the association between Recall and the two predictor variables as follows:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Recall & Intervention Group

```{r}
#| label: fig-recall-desc1
#| fig-cap: "Association between Recall and Intervention Group"
recall_plt1 <- ggplot(data = recdata, aes(x = group, y = perc_recall, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(x = "Intervention Group", y = "Recall (%)", title = "Association between Recall and Intervention")
recall_plt1
```

### Recall & Age

```{r}
#| label: fig-recall-desc2
#| fig-cap: "Association between Recall and Age"
recall_plt2 <- ggplot(data = recdata, aes(x = age, y = perc_recall)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Age (in years)", y = "Recall (%)", title = "Association between Recall and Age")
recall_plt2
```

:::

:::

From @tbl-cog-descript, @fig-recall-desc1, and @fig-recall-desc2 we can see:  
  
+ there were more participants in the rollercoaster condition than meditation  
+ participants in the meditation condition had higher recall scores than those in the rollercoaster condition  
+ there was less variability in scores in the meditation condition in comparison to the rollercoaster condition  
+ older age appeared to be associated with lower recall scores  

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(3)`

Use a scatterplot to visualise the association between recall and age by group. 

Is there any evidence of an interaction between age and group?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

For a recap on how to create a scatterplot, review the [data visualisation - bivariate examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b3_reading.html#visual-exploration).

- It might be useful to specify the `color = ` argument for your grouping variable
- Consider using `geom_smooth()` to superimpose the best-fitting line describing the association of interest for each intervention group. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r, message = FALSE}
#| label: fig-recall-desc3
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot displaying the association between age, intervention group, and recall"
recall_plt3 <- ggplot(data = recdata, aes(x = age, y = perc_recall, color = group)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    labs(x = "Age (in years)", y = "Recall (%)", title = "Associations among Recall Score, \nAge, and Intervention Group")
recall_plt3
```

The slope in @fig-recall-desc3 appears to be stepper in the roller coaster intervention group than the meditation group - this suggested that there could be an interaction.

<div class="divider div-transparent div-dot"></div>

## Sample Size & Power

`r qbegin(4)`

Using a significance level ($\alpha$) of .05, what sample size ($n$) would you require to check whether any of the predictors (including their interaction) influenced recall scores with a 90% chance?

Because you do not know the effect size, assume Cohen's guideline for linear regression and, to be on the safe side, consider the 'small' value.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the following flashcards on [statistical power & effect size](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-power-effect-size), paying particular attention to the following two flashcards - *The pwr Package* and *Power for Linear Regression*. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
k <- 3
f2 <- .02
pwr.f2.test(u = k, f2 = f2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

:::{.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

A power analysis for a multiple regression model $(k = 3)$ was conducted (via the `pwr` package) to determine the minimum sample size using an $\alpha$ = .05, power = .90, and small effect size $(f^2 = .02)$. 

The required sample size is $n = \text v + k + 1 = 709 + 3 + 1 = 713$.

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(5)`

Using the same $\alpha$ and power, what would be the sample size if you assumed effect size to be 'medium'?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the following flashcards on [statistical power & effect size](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-power-effect-size), paying particular attention to the following two flashcards - *The pwr Package* and *Power for Linear Regression*. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
k <- 3
f2 <- .15
pwr.f2.test(u = k, f2 = f2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

:::{.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

A power analysis for a multiple regression model $(k = 3)$ was conducted (via the `pwr` package) to determine the minimum sample size using an $\alpha$ = .05, power = .90, and moderate effect size $(f^2 = .15)$. 

The required sample size is $n = \text v + k + 1 = 95 + 3 + 1 = 99$.

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(6)`

Using the same $\alpha$ and power, what would be the sample size if you assumed effect size to be 'large'?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the following flashcards on [statistical power & effect size](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-power-effect-size), paying particular attention to the following two flashcards - *The pwr Package* and *Power for Linear Regression*. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
k <- 3
f2 <- .35
pwr.f2.test(u = k, f2 = f2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

:::{.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

A power analysis for a multiple regression model $(k = 3)$ was conducted (via the `pwr` package) to determine the minimum sample size using an $\alpha$ = .05, power = .90, and large effect size $(f^2 = .35)$. 

The required sample size is $n = \text v + k + 1 = 41 + 3 + 1 = 45$.

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(7)`

Fit the following model using `lm()`, and assign it as an object with the name "recall_mdl1".

$$
\text{Recall} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Age  + \epsilon \\
$$

How much variance in recall scores does the model explain?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

For a recap on how to specify a simple linear model, review the [statistical models flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-models). 

The proportion of the total variability explained is given by $R^2$. For a more detailed overview, see the [R-squared and Adjusted R-squared flashcard](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#model-fit). 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
recall_mdl1 <- lm(perc_recall ~ age, data = recdata)
summary(recall_mdl1)
```

We can see both the $R^2$ and Adjusted $R^2$ from the model `summary()` output. We can use either since we only have a single predictor. To be conservative, we might want to use the adjusted $R^2$ (0.16).  

The model, with Age as a single predictor, explained approximately 16% of the variance in recall scores.

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(8)`

Imagine you found the $R^2$ that you computed above (Q7) in a paper, and you are using that to base your next study.

A researcher believes that the inclusion of intervention group and its interaction with age should explain an extra 50% of the variation in recall scores.

Using a significance level of 5%, what sample size should you use for your next data collection in order to discover that effect with a power of 0.90?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the following flashcards on [statistical power & effect size](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-power-effect-size), paying particular attention to the following two flashcards - *The pwr Package* and *Power for Linear Regression*. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
# restricted model m - number of predictors & R-squared
k <- 1
R2m <- 0.16

# full model M - number of predictors & R-squared
K <- 3
R2M <- 0.16 + 0.5

# effect size - calculate f2
f2 <- (R2M - R2m) / (1 - R2M)

#run test
pwr.f2.test(u = K - k, f2 = f2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

The sample size should be:

$$
n = \text v + K + 1 \quad \quad n = 10 + 3 + 1 \quad \quad n = 14    
$$

With such a big effect size, don't be surprised it's so small. When the effect size is much smaller, that will be harder to detect and you will require a bigger sample size.

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(9)`

Suppose that the aforementioned researcher made a mistake, and issues a corrected statement in which they state that the inclusion of intervention group and its interaction with age should explain an extra 5% of the variation in recall scores.

Using a significance level of 5%, what sample size should you use for your next data collection in order to discover that effect with a power of 0.90?

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

Review the following flashcards on [statistical power & effect size](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#statistical-power-effect-size), paying particular attention to the following two flashcards - *The pwr Package* and *Power for Linear Regression*. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
# restricted model m - number of predictors & R-squared
k <- 1
R2m <- 0.16

# full model M - number of predictors & R-squared
K <- 3
R2M <- 0.16 + 0.05

# effect size - calculate f2
f2 <- (R2M - R2m) / (1 - R2M)

# run test
pwr.f2.test(u = K - k, f2 = f2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

The sample size should be:

$$
n = \text v + K + 1 \quad \quad  n = 200 + 3 + 1 \quad \quad n = 204 
$$

With such a small effect size, we need a bigger sample size for us to detect it with high confidence.

`r solend()`

`r qbegin(10)`

A colleague produces a visualisation of the joint relationship between sample size and effect size via a power curve (with coloured lines representing large, medium, and small effect sizes).

Based on this, what feedback/comments might you share with them regarding sample size for their prospective study, and its relation to effect size?  

```{r, echo= FALSE}
#| label: fig-pcurve
#| fig-cap: "Linear Regression with power = 0.90 and alpha = 0.05"
## step 1: create a tibble containing a sequence seq of effect sizes to investigate, and apply computation
es_curve <- tibble(
    es = seq(.1, .9, .01),
    v = map_dbl(es, 
                ~ pwr.f2.test(u = 4, f2 = .x, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)$v)
)

## step 2: Now, we want to compute n from v, using n−K−1=v so that n=v+K+1
es_curve <- es_curve %>%
    mutate(n = v + 4 + 1)

## step 3: visualise the sample size required to find each effect size
pwr_plt <- ggplot(es_curve, aes(n, es)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 1.25) +
    ylim(0,1) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept=0.35, color = "#D55E00", linewidth = 0.75) + 
    annotate("text", x=155, y=0.40, label="Large", size=5, color="#D55E00") +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0.15, color = "#56B4E9", linewidth = 0.75) + 
    annotate("text", x=155, y=0.20, label="Medium", size=5, color="#56B4E9") +
    geom_hline(yintercept=0.02, color = "#009E73", linewidth = 0.75) + 
    annotate("text", x=155, y=0.06, label="Small", size=5, color="#009E73") +
    labs(x = "Sample Size",
         y = "Effect Size",
         title = "Linear regression with power = 0.90 and alpha = 0.05")
pwr_plt
```

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

From @fig-pcurve, to detect a large effect size (red line), they should aim to recruit ~50 participants, for a medium effect size ~100 (blue line). It is impossible to judge how many participants would be required to detect a small effect size (green line) - we would suggest that they conduct their own power calculation as it is too difficult to judge based on the figure alone. 

Generally, if they want to be able to detect a medium-large effect with 90% power using $\alpha = .05$, it appears that there is little gain in recruiting a sample size > ~110. However, if they want to be able to detect a small effect with 90% power using $\alpha = .05$, they are likely going to require a very large sample size. 

To summarise the association between effect size and sample size, it appears that the smaller the effect you are trying to detect, the larger the sample size you will require.
