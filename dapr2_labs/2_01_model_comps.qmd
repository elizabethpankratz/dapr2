__Description__

From the Edinburgh & Lothians, 100 city/suburb residences and 100 rural residences were chosen at random and contacted to participate in the study. The Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), was used to measure mental health and well-being. 

Participants filled out a questionnaire including items concerning: estimated average number of hours spent outdoors each week, estimated average number of social interactions each week (whether on-line or in-person), whether a daily routine is followed (yes/no). For those respondents who had an activity tracker app or smart watch, they were asked to provide their average weekly number of steps.  
  
The data in `wellbeing.csv` contain seven attributes collected from a random sample of $n=200$ hypothetical residents over Edinburgh & Lothians, and include:  

- `wellbeing`: Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.  
- `outdoor_time`: Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors  
- `social_int`: Self report estimated number of social interactions per week (both online and in-person)
- `routine`: Binary 1=Yes/0=No response to the question "Do you follow a daily routine throughout the week?"
- `location`: Location of primary residence (City, Suburb, Rural)
- `steps_k`: Average weekly number of steps in thousands (as given by activity tracker if available)
- `age`: Age in years of respondent

__Preview__

The first six rows of the data are:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
read_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv') %>% head %>% gt::gt()
```
 
`r optend()`

# Setup

`r qbegin("Setup", qlabel = FALSE)`  

1. Create a new RMarkdown file
2. Load the required package(s)
3. Read the wellbeing_rural dataset into R, assigning it to an object named `wrdata` 
 
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r message=FALSE}
#Loading the required package(s)
library(tidyverse)
library(stargazer)

#Reading in data and storing in object named 'wrdata'
wrdata <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeing_rural.csv")
```

`r solend()`

# Exercises

`r qbegin(1)`

Check coding of variables (e.g., that categorical variables are coded as factors), and create a new binary variable which specifies whether or not each participant lives in a rural location.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

You will need to use two functions - firstly `mutate()`, and then `ifelse()` when creating your new variable (which should also be coded as a factor). 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
#before we create our new variable, it would be helpful to give a more informative name to the levels of the routine variable as opposed to 0s and 1s

wrdata <-  wrdata %>% 
    mutate(
        routine = factor(routine,
                         levels = c(0,1),
                         labels = c("No", "Yes")),
        isRural = factor(ifelse(location == "rural","rural","not rural"))
    )
```

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(2)`

Using `fct_relevel()`, specify ‘not rural’ as your reference group for your newly created variable (i.e., the isRural variable).


`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
wrdata$isRural <- fct_relevel(wrdata$isRural, "not rural")
```


`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(3)`

Fit the below 5 models required to address the three research questions stated above. Note down which model(s) will be used to address each research question, and examine the results of each model. 

Name the models as follows: "wb_mdl0", "wb_mdl1", "wb_mdl2", "wb_mdl3", and "wb_mdl4".

<br>
$$
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0  + \epsilon
$$
<br>
$$
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 \cdot Social Interactions + \epsilon
$$
<br>
$$
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 \cdot Social Interactions + \beta_2 \cdot Location_{Rural} + \epsilon
$$
<br>
$$
\begin{split}
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Social Interactions + \beta_2 \cdot Location_{Rural} \\+ \beta_3 \cdot (Social Interactions \cdot Location_{Rural}) + \epsilon
\end{split}
$$
<br>
$$
\begin{split}
\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Social Interactions + \beta_2 \cdot Location_{Rural} \\+ \beta_3 \cdot (Social Interactions \cdot Location_{Rural}) + \beta_4 \cdot \text{Outdoor Time} + \epsilon
\end{split}
$$

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

The `summary()` function will be useful to examine the model output. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
#null/intercept only model
wb_mdl0 <- lm(wellbeing ~ 1, data = wrdata)
summary(wb_mdl0)

#model with social interactions
wb_mdl1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int, data = wrdata)
summary(wb_mdl1)

#model with social interactions and location (rural vs non-rural)
wb_mdl2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + isRural, data = wrdata)
summary(wb_mdl2)

#model with social interactions and location (rural vs non-rural) interaction term
wb_mdl3 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int*isRural, data = wrdata)
summary(wb_mdl3)

#model with social interactions and location (rural vs non-rural) term, and outdoor time
wb_mdl4 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int*isRural + outdoor_time, data= wrdata)
summary(wb_mdl4)
```


The models required to address each research question (RQ) are as follows:
- RQ1: Models wb_mdl0 and wb_mdl1 
- RQ2: Models wb_mdl2 and wb_mdl3
- RQ3: Models wb_mdl3 and wb_mdl4

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(4)`

Provide key model results from the two models required to address RQ1 - whether there is an overall effect of the number of social interactions on wellbeing scores - in a single formatted table.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

You will need to use a new package to do this - **stargazer**. 

Like `tab_model()` that you have used in many previous labs, `stargazer()` can take lots of different arguments to customize and build a table. You may want to consider specifying the below (and remember you can use the helper function via `?stargazer()` for further information about the functionality of the package):

- `title = ` - specify the title of your table
- `dep.var.labels =` - specify the name of your dependent variable(s)
- `covariate.labels =` - specify the names of your covariates (or independent) variables
- `type = ` - specify whether you want 'html' (use when knitting to HTML), 'latex' (use when knitting to PDF), or 'text' (use when knitting to Word)
- `digits = ` - specify rounding (remember [APA standard](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf) is, in most cases, 2 decimal places) 
- `intercept.bottom = ` - specify if you want the intercept (or 'constant') value to be printed at the bottom (TRUE) or top (FALSE) of the output

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
stargazer(wb_mdl0, wb_mdl1,
          title="Regression Model Results for RQ1",
          dep.var.labels=c("Wellbeing Score"),
          covariate.labels=c("Intercept", "Number of Social Interactions"), 
          type = "html", 
          digits = 2,
          single.row=TRUE, 
          align=TRUE,
          intercept.bottom = FALSE)
```

`r solend()`


<br> 

`r qbegin(5)`

Is there a main effect of the number of weekly social interactions?

Check that the $F$-statistic and the $p$-value are the the same as that which is given at the bottom of `summary(wb_mdl1)`. 


:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

Use the `anova()` function to perform a model comparison between your model with social interactions (wb_mdl1) to the null model (wb_mdl0). 

Remember that the null model tests the null hypothesis that all beta coefficients are zero. By comparing *wb_mdl0* to *wb_mdl1*, we can test whether we should include the IV of social_int.

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
# model comparison wb_mdl0 vs wb_mdl1
anova(wb_mdl0, wb_mdl1)

# extract f statistic from summary of wb_mdl1
summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic

# we can retrieve the p-value:
fstat = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[1]
df_1 = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[2]
df_2 = summary(wb_mdl1)$fstatistic[3]
pf(fstat, df_1, df_2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```


```{r include=FALSE}
mc_1 <- anova(wb_mdl0, wb_mdl1)
names(mc_1)[6]<-"p"
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

The number of social interactions was found to explain a significant amount of variance in wellbeing scores ($F$(`r paste(mc_1$Df[2],mc_1$Res.df[2],collapse=",")`)=`r round(mc_1$F[2],2)`, $p$`r map_chr(mc_1$p[2], ~ifelse(.<001,"<.001",paste0("=",round(.,2))))`). There was a main effect of social interactions. 

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(6)`

Does the association between number of social interactions and wellbeing differ between rural and non-rural residents?

Provide key model results from the two models in a single formatted table, and report the results of the model comparison in [APA format](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf).

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

To address RQ2, you need to compare "wb_mdl2" and "wb_mdl3"

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
stargazer(wb_mdl2, wb_mdl3,
          title="Regression Model Results for RQ2",
          dep.var.labels=c("Wellbeing Score"),
          covariate.labels=c("Intercept", "Number of Social Interactions", "Location - Rural", "Number of Social Interactions * Location - Rural"), 
          type = "html", 
          digits = 2,
          single.row=TRUE, 
          align=TRUE,
          intercept.bottom = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# model comparison wb_mdl0 vs wb_mdl1
anova(wb_mdl2, wb_mdl3)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
mc_2 <- anova(wb_mdl2, wb_mdl3)
names(mc_2)[6]<-"p"
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

There was a significant interaction between the number of social interactions and location (rural vs non-rural) ($F$(`r paste(mc_2$Df[2],mc_2$Res.df[2],collapse=",")`)=`r round(mc_2$F[2],2)`, $p$`r map_chr(mc_2$p[2], ~ifelse(.<001,"<.001",paste0("=",round(.,2))))`). This suggested that the association between number of social interactions and wellbeing did differ between rural and non-rural residents.

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(7)`

Look at the amount of variation in wellbeing scores explained by models "wb_mdl3" and "wb_mdl4". 

From this, can we answer the third research question of whether weekly outdoor time explains a significant amount of variance in wellbeing scores over and above the interaction between weekly social interactions and location (rural vs not-rural)?  

Provide justification/rationale for your answer. 

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

Recall from Semester 1 that to determine how much variation is explained by a model, we need to look at our $R^2$ values (specifically the adjusted $R^2$ value in this case since the models have multiple predictors. 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Let's look at the amount of variance explained by each model:
```{r}
summary(wb_mdl3)$adj.r.squared
summary(wb_mdl4)$adj.r.squared
```

The model *with* weekly outdoor time as a predictor explains 34\% of the variance, and the model *without* explains 29\%. But, from only looking at the proportion of variance accounted for in each model, we cannot determine which model is statistically a better fit. To answer the question 'Does including weekly outdoor time as a predictor provide a significantly better fit of the data?' we need to **statistically compare** wb_mdl3 to wb_mdl4.

`r solend()`

<br> 

`r qbegin(8)`

Does weekly outdoor time explain a significant amount of variance in wellbeing scores over and above the interaction between weekly social interactions and location (rural vs not-rural)?

Provide key model results from the two models in a single formatted table, and report the results of the model comparison in [APA format](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf).

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

To address RQ3, you need to compare "wb_mdl3" and "wb_mdl4"

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
stargazer(wb_mdl3, wb_mdl4,
          title="Regression Model Results for RQ1",
          dep.var.labels=c("Wellbeing Score"),
          covariate.labels=c("Intercept", "Number of Social Interactions", "Location - Rural", "Outdoor Time (Hours)", "Number of Social Interactions * Location - Rural"), 
          type = "html", 
          digits = 2,
          single.row=TRUE, 
          align=TRUE,
          intercept.bottom = FALSE)
```

```{r}
anova(wb_mdl3, wb_mdl4)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
mc_3 <- anova(wb_mdl3, wb_mdl4)
names(mc_3)[6]<-"p"
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

Weekly outdoor time was found to explain a significant amount of variance in wellbeing scores over and above weekly social interactions and location ($F$(`r paste(mc_3$Df[2],mc_3$Res.df[2],collapse=",")`)=`r round(mc_3$F[2],2)`, $p$`r map_chr(mc_3$p[2], ~ifelse(.<001,"<.001",paste0("=",round(.,2))))`).

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(9)`

Compare the two following models, each looking at the associations of Wellbeing scores and two different predictor variables. 

$\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Social Interactions} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Age} + \epsilon$  

$\text{Wellbeing} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Outdoor Time} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Routine} + \epsilon$ 

In [APA format](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf), report which model you think best fits the data. 


:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

Compare using `AIC()` and `BIC()` since the models are non-nested.

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
#fit models
wb_socint_age <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + age, data = wrdata)
wb_outdoor_routine <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + routine, data = wrdata)
```

```{r}
#AIC values
AIC(wb_socint_age, wb_outdoor_routine)

#BIC values
BIC(wb_socint_age, wb_outdoor_routine)
```

::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance="minimal"}

We used AIC and BIC model selection to distinguish between two possible models describing the association between several personal factors and wellbeing scores. The model with  outdoor time and routine included as predictors was better fitting (AIC = 1220.91) the alternative model with  weekly number of social interactions and age (AIC = 1236.58). Based on the BIC value of the former model (BIC = 1234.11) we concluded that it was substantively better fitting than the alternative, latter model (BIC = 1249.77). 

:::

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(10)`

The code below fits 5 different models based on our `wrdata`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time, data = wrdata)
model2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + age, data = wrdata)
model3 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine, data = wrdata)
model4 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine + age, data = wrdata)
model5 <- lm(wellbeing ~ social_int + outdoor_time + routine + steps_k, data = wrdata)
```

For each of the below pairs of models, what methods are/are not available for us to use for comparison and why?  

+ `model1` vs `model2`
+ `model2` vs `model3`
+ `model1` vs `model4`
+ `model3` vs `model5`

This flowchart might help you to reach your decision:

```{r comparisons_chart, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'left', out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/comparisons_chart.png")
```

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint 

You may need to examine the dataset, and check for accuracy (e.g., are there any impossible / out of range values?) and completeness (e.g., are there any missing values?). 

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

+ `model1` vs `model2`  
  These models are nested - `model2` contains all the variables of `model1` and they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use an $F$-test or AIC and BIC.  
    
+ `model2` vs `model3`  
  These models are __not__ nested, but they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use AIC or BIC, but we cannot use an $F$-test.  
    
+ `model1` vs `model4`
  These models are nested - `model4` contains all the variables of `model1` and they are fitted on the same dataset.  
  We can therefore use an $F$-test or AIC and BIC.  
    
+ `model3` vs `model5`  
  These models are __not__ nested, and they are __not__ fitted on the same dataset. The "steps_k" variable contains missing values (over 30% of the data is missing for this variable), and so these whole rows are excluded from `model5` (but they are included in `model3`). We cannot compare these models.   

`r solend()`
