# Study Overview

> **Research Question** 
>
> Are there differences in types of memory deficits for those experiencing different cognitive impairment(s)?

A group of researchers wants to test a hypothesised theory according to which the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will be greatest for Huntington patients in comparison to controls. On the other hand, the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will not significantly differ between patients with amnesia in comparison to controls.

`r optbegin("Cognitive Exp 3x2 data codebook.", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)` 

__Description__

The researchers designed a study yielding a 3 by 2 factorial design to test this theory. The first factor, "Diagnosis", classifies the three types of individuals:

- 1 denotes amnesic patients;
- 2 denotes Huntingtons patients; and
- 3 denotes a control group of individuals with no known neurological disorder.

The second factor, "Task", tells us to which of two tasks each study participant was randomly assigned to:

- 1 = grammar task, which consists of classifying letter sequences as either following or not following grammatical rules; and
- 2 = recognition task, which consists of recognising particular stimuli as stimuli that have previously been presented during the task.

Keep in mind that each person has been randomly assigned to one of the two tasks, so there are five observations per cell of the design.^[Some researchers may point out that a design where each person was assessed on both tasks might have been more efficient. However, the task factor in such design would then be within-subjects, meaning that the scores corresponding to the same person would be correlated. To analyse such design we will need a different method which is discussed next year!]

The tasks chosen by the researchers have been picked to map onto the theoretical differences between the three types of research participants. The first task (grammar) is known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes. If the theory is correct, we would expect the difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks to be relatively similar for the control and amnesiac groups, but relatively larger for the Huntingtons group compared to controls.

# Exercises

`r qbegin(1)`

Examine the dataset, and perform any necessary and appropriate data management steps.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint
- Convert categorical variables to factors
- Label appropriately factors to aid with your model interpretations
- If needed, provide better variable names

Note that all of these steps can be done in combination - the `mutate()` and `factor()` functions will likely be useful here. 
:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Let's have a look at the data to see what we're working with:
```{r}
#first look at dataset structure
str(cog)

#now lets look at top 6 rows (or the head) of the dataset
head(cog)
```

The columns Diagnosis and Task should be coded into factors with better labels, as currently, without making reference to the codebook, it is not clear what "1" and "2" represent. It is also unclear what the Y column represents - this should be renamed. 

```{r}
#We can make all of the changes noted above in one (long command). 
#First we can use the function `factor()` by specifying the current levels and what labels each level should map to. 
#We can also simply rename the Y column to score. 

cog <- cog %>%
    mutate(
        Diagnosis = factor(Diagnosis, 
                           levels = c(1, 2, 3),
                           labels = c('Amnesic', 'Huntingtons', 'Control')),
        Task = factor(Task, 
                      levels = c(1, 2),
                      labels = c('Grammar', 'Recognition'))) %>%
    rename(Score = Y)

#Use head() function to check renaming
head(cog)
```

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(2)`

Choose appropriate reference levels for the Diagnosis and Task variables.

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

The Diagnosis factor has a group coded 'Control' which lends itself naturally to be the reference category.

```{r}
cog$Diagnosis <- relevel(cog$Diagnosis, 'Control')

levels(cog$Diagnosis)
```

There is no natural reference category for the Task factor, so we will leave it unaltered. However, if you are of a different opinion, please note that there is no absolute correct answer. As long as you interpret the model correctly, you will reach to the same conclusions as someone that has chosen a different baseline category.

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(3)`

Formally state:

- a linear model to investigate whether there are differences in types of memory deficits for those experiencing different cognitive impairment(s)
- your chosen significance level
- the null and alternative hypotheses

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Before stating the model, you first need to define the dummy variables for Diagnosis:

$$
D_\text{Amnesic} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if Diagnosis is Amnesic} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\quad
D_\text{Huntingtons} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if Diagnosis is Huntingtons} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\quad 
(\text{Control is base level})
$$

And for Task:

$$
T_\text{Recognition} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if Task is Recognition} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\quad
(\text{Grammar is base level})
$$
The model becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Score &= \beta_0 \\
      &+ \beta_1 D_\text{Amnesic} + \beta_2 D_\text{Huntingtons}  \\
      &+ \beta_3 T_\text{Recognition}  \\
      &+ \beta_4 (D_\text{Amnesic} * T_\text{Recognition}) + \beta_5 (D_\text{Huntingtons} * T_\text{Recognition})  \\
      &+ \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$
Effects will be considered statistically significant at $\alpha=.05$

Our hypotheses are:

$H_0: \beta_4 | \beta_5 = 0$

The effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does not vary depending on level of Neuroticism

$H_0: \beta_4 | \beta_5 \neq 0$

The effect of social comparison on symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress does vary depending on level of Neuroticism.

`r qbegin(4)`

Provide a table of descriptive statistics and visualise your data. 
 
Remember to interpret your plot in the context of the study.

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple" collapse="true"}

### Hint

1. For your table of descriptive statistics, both the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions will come in handy here. 
2. Recall that when visualising categorical variables, `geom_boxplot()` may be most appropriate to use.    

:::
 
`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

First, lets look at our descriptive statistics and present in a well formatted table:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-cog-descript
#| tbl-cap: Descriptive Statistics
cog_desc <- cog %>% 
            group_by(Diagnosis, Task) %>%
            summarise(Mean = mean(Score),
                      SD = sd(Score)) %>% 
            kable(caption = "Descriptive Statistics", digits = 2) %>%
            kable_styling()

cog_desc
```

Next, look at associations among variables of interest:

```{r}
#| label: fig-cog-desc
#| fig-cap: "Associations among Score, Diagnosis, and Task"
cog_plt <- ggplot(cog, aes(x = Diagnosis, y = Score, fill = Task)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
cog_plt
```
`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(5)`

Fit the specified model using `lm()`, and store the model in an object named "cog_mdl".

:::{.callout-note}

Fortunately, `R` computes the dummy variables for us! Thus. each row in the `summary()` output of the model will correspond to one of the estimated $\beta$'s in the equation above.

:::

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
#fit interaction model
cog_mdl <- lm(Score ~ Diagnosis * Task, data = cog)

#check model output
summary(cog_mdl)
```

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(6)`

Recall your table of descriptive statistics - map each coefficient from the `summary()` output from "cog_mdl" to the group means.

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cog_desc
```

- $\hat{\beta}_0$ = 80  
  = Mean(Control, Grammar)

- $\hat{\beta}_1$ = -20

  = 60 - 80

  = [Mean(Huntingtons, Recognition) - Mean(Huntingtons, Grammar)] -  
  [Mean(Control, Recognition) - Mean(Control, Grammar)]  
  = [95 - 40] - [95 - 80] = 55 - 15 = 40

`r solend()`

<br> 

`r qbegin(7)`
Using the `probe_interaction()` function from the interactions package, visualise the interaction effects from your model.

Try to summarise the interaction effects in a short and concise sentence. 

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
#plt_cog_mdl <- probe_interaction(model = cog_mdl, 
#                  modx = Diagnosis, 
#                  mod2 = Task, 
#                  interval = T, 
#                  main.title = "Neuroticism moderating the effect of\nsocial comparison on depression and anxiety",
#                  x.label = "Diagnosis",
#                  y.label = "Score",
#                  legend.main = "Task")
```

The red dots ('Grammar') represent the baseline for Task, while 'Control' is the baseline for Diagnosis.

If you imagine connecting the dots of the same color with a line, you can see that the two virtual lines are not parallel, suggesting the presence of an interaction. The difference in score between recognition and grammar tasks for Huntingtons patients (consider the vertical difference) is larger than the difference in score between recognition and grammar tasks for the Control patients. If those vertical differences were the same, there would be no interaction.

`r solend()`

<br>

`r qbegin(7)`
An alternative to `plot_model()` is the function `emmip()` (from the `emmeans` package) which stands for *EMM*eans *I*nteraction *P*lot. Use the function `emmip()` to investigate the interactions.

**Hint**: You must provide as the first argument the fitted model, then a special formula saying what to plot on the x axis and what to use to differentiate the colors: `colors ~ x`, and then `CIs = TRUE` tells the function to display uncertainty intervals.

`r qend()`

`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
emmip(cog_mdl, Task ~ Diagnosis, CIs = TRUE)
```

`r solend()`

## Visualising the interactions

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/int_cc/int_cc.png')
```

In the interaction plot above you can see three highlighted differences, where the differences are denoted with the Greek letter $\Delta$ ("delta") with a hat on top, $\hat \Delta$, to denote that those are **estimates** for the unknown population differences based on the available sample data. 
The corresponding population differences are unknown as we don't have the data for the entire population, and they are denoted with a $\Delta$ without a hat on top.

You can see highlighted:

- The difference in the mean score between Recognition and Grammar for Control patients, $\hat \Delta_{\text{Control}}$
- The difference in the mean score between Recognition and Grammar for Amnesic patients, $\hat \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}}$
- The difference in the mean score between Recognition and Grammar for Huntingtons patients, $\hat \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}}$

An interaction is present if the effect of Task (i.e. the difference in mean score between Recognition and Grammar tasks) substantially varies across the possible values for Diagnosis. That is, if the difference for Amnesic is not the same as that for Control, or if the difference for Huntingtons is not the same as that for Control, or both.

The model summary returns two rows for the interactions. Let's focus on this row:

```
## DiagnosisAmnesic:TaskRecognition      -10.000     11.719  -0.853  0.40192    
```

It returns an estimate for the difference

$$
\hat \beta_4 = \hat \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}} - \hat \Delta_{\text{Control}}
$$

and also performs a test for the hypothesis that the differences are equal **in the population**:

$$
H_0: \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}} = \Delta_{\text{Control}} \\
H_1: \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}} \neq \Delta_{\text{Control}}
$$

or, equivalently, that:

$$
H_0: \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}} - \Delta_{\text{Control}} = 0 \\
H_1: \Delta_{\text{Amnesic}} - \Delta_{\text{Control}} \neq 0 
$$

Let's now focus on the last row:

```
## DiagnosisHuntingtons:TaskRecognition   40.000     11.719   3.413  0.00228 ** 
```

It returns an estimate for the difference

$$
\hat \beta_5 = \hat \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}} - \hat \Delta_{\text{Control}}
$$

and also performs a test for the hypothesis that the differences are equal **in the population**:

$$
H_0: \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}} = \Delta_{\text{Control}} \\
H_1: \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}} \neq \Delta_{\text{Control}}
$$

or, equivalently, that:

$$
H_0: \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}} - \Delta_{\text{Control}} = 0 \\
H_1: \Delta_{\text{Huntingtons}} - \Delta_{\text{Control}} \neq 0 
$$

Use `tab_model()` from the __sjPlot__ package. 

Remember that you can rename your DV and IV labels by specifying `dv.labels` and `pred.labels`.

The difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks, respectively measuring explicit and implicit memory, for Huntingtons patients in comparison to controls was significant and indicated a difference of $\hat \beta_5 = 40$ points in explicit vs implicit memory performance: $t(24) = 3.41, p = .002$.

The difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks, respectively measuring explicit and implicit memory, for amnesiac patients in comparison to controls was estimated to be $\hat \beta_4 = -10$ points but it is not found to be significantly different from 0: $t(24) = -0.85, p = .40$.

This indicates that the researchers' hypothesis that the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks does not differ significantly between amnesic and control patients, while it does differ significantly between Huntington and control patients.

Compared to controls, amnesiac patients will have a significant deficit in explicit memory (as measured by the recognition task), but not on implicit memory (as measured by the grammar task).

Compared to controls, Huntingtons patients will have a significant deficit in implicit memory (as measured by the grammar task) but not in explicit memory (as measured by the recognition task).
