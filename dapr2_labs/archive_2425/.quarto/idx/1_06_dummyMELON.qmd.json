They hypothesised that sleep deprived individuals would have slower reaction times than non-sleep deprived individuals. \n\nTo test this, they recruited 60 participants who were matched on a number of demographic variables including age and sex. One member of each pair (e.g., female, aged 18) was placed into a different sleep condition - 'Sleep Deprived' (4 hours per night) or 'Non-Sleep Deprived' (8 hours per night).\n\n## Experiment 2\n\nA group of researchers were interested in replicating an experiment testing the Stroop Effect. \n\nThey recruited 50 participants who took part in Task A (word colour and meaning are congruent) and Task B (word colour and meaning are incongruent) where they were asked to name the color of the ink instead of reading the word. The order of presentation was counterbalanced across participants. The researchers hypothesised that participants would take significantly more time ('response time' measured in seconds) to complete Task B than Task A.\n\nYou can test yourself here for fun: [Stroop Task](https://www.psytoolkit.org/lessons/experiment_stroop.html)\n\n## Experiment 3\n\nA group of researchers wanted to test a hypothesised theory according to which patients with amnesia will have a deficit in explicit memory but not implicit memory. Huntingtons patients, on the other hand, will display the opposite: they will have no deficit in explicit memory, but will have a deficit in implicit memory.\n\nTo test this, researchers designed a study that included two variables: 'Diagnosis' (Amnesic, Huntingtons, Control) and 'Task' (Grammar, Classification, Recognition) where participants were randomly assigned to a Task condition. The first two tasks (Grammar and Classification) are known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the Recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes.\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Experiment 1\n\n1. Design = Between-person: Matched pairs\n2. Number of variables of interest = 2 - Sleep Condition and Reaction Time\n3. Levels of variables = Sleep Condition has 2 levels - Sleep Deprived and Non-Sleep Deprived; Reaction Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\n4. Reference Group = Sleep Condition - Non-Sleep Deprived because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how the sleep deprived group *differed from* the non-sleep deprived group. \n\n## Experiment 2\n\n1. Design = Within-person: Repeated measures (this is a study design that you will learn more about in DAPR3!)\n2. Number of variables of interest = 2 - Task and Response Time \n3. Levels of variables = Task has 2 levels - A and B; Response Time is a continuous measure, so has no associated levels\n4. Reference Group = Task - A because the research question stated that the researchers were interested in how response time in Task B *differed from* the response time in Task A. \n\n## Experiment 3\n\n1. Design = Between-person: 3×3 factorial design \n2. Number of variables of interest = 2 - Diagnosis and Task\n3. Levels of variables = Diagnosis has 3 levels - Amnesic, Huntingtons, and Control; Task has 3 levels - Grammar, Classification, and Recognition\n4. Reference Groups = Diagnosis - Control; Task - Recognition. We have chosen Control since the other two groups have some form of cognitive impairment; and the Recognition task since it measures explicit memory whilst the other two task types implicit. \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Compile Report\n\n`r qbegin(\"Compile Report\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\nKnit your report to PDF, and check over your work.
