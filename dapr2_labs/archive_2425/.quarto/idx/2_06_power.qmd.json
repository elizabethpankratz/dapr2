Participants were aged 18-75 years old, and were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (exciting - 1-hour long roller-coaster session; or relaxing - 1-hour long meditation session) before completing a free-recall test (% correct). \n\nThe 'group' variable denoting which intervention type participants were allocated to was coded as a factor with two levels - 'rollercoaster' and 'meditation', where 'rollercoaster' was designated as the reference group. There were no `NAs` contained within the dataset, and recall scores were within range (i.e., within possible values of 0-100), as were ages (i.e., all ages ranged from 18-75).\n\nTo address the research question of whether age and intervention type influence recall, we can specify our model as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Recall} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}  + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}} + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Age} \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}}) + \\epsilon\n$$\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at $\\alpha=.05$.\n\nOur hypotheses are:\n\n$H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$\n\nThe association between recall and age does not differ by intervention type. \n\n$H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0$\n\nThe association between recall and age does differ by intervention type.  \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Descriptive Statistics & Visualisations\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nProvide a table of descriptive statistics and visualise your data.\n\nRemember to interpret your findings in the context of the study. \n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\nReview the many ways to numerically and visually explore your data by reading over the [data exploration flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration).\n\nFor examples, see flashcards on [descriptives statistics tables - categorical and numeric values examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration) and [data visualisation - bivariate examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#visual-exploration), paying particular attention to the type of data that you're working with.\n\nMore specifically:    \n1.

Participants were aged 18-75 years old, and were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups (exciting - 1-hour long roller-coaster session; or relaxing - 1-hour long meditation session) before completing a free-recall test (% correct). \n\nThe 'group' variable denoting which intervention type participants were allocated to was coded as a factor with two levels - 'rollercoaster' and 'meditation', where 'rollercoaster' was designated as the reference group. There were no `NAs` contained within the dataset, and recall scores were within range (i.e., within possible values of 0-100), as were ages (i.e., all ages ranged from 18-75).\n\nTo address the research question of whether age and intervention type influence recall, we can specify our model as follows:\n\n$$\n\\text{Recall} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Age}  + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}} + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Age} \\cdot \\text{Intervention Group}_{\\text{Meditation}}) + \\epsilon\n$$\nEffects will be considered statistically significant at $\\alpha=.05$.\n\nOur hypotheses are:\n\n$H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$\n\nThe association between recall and age does not differ by intervention type. \n\n$H_1: \\beta_3 \\neq 0$\n\nThe association between recall and age does differ by intervention type.  \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n## Descriptive Statistics & Visualisations\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nProvide a table of descriptive statistics and visualise your data.\n\nRemember to interpret your findings in the context of the study. \n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Hint\n\nReview the many ways to numerically and visually explore your data by reading over the [data exploration flashcards](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration).\n\nFor examples, see flashcards on [descriptives statistics tables - categorical and numeric values examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#data-exploration) and [data visualisation - bivariate examples](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html#visual-exploration), paying particular attention to the type of data that you're working with.\n\nMore specifically:    \n1.

It is impossible to judge how many participants would be required to detect a small effect size (green line) - we would suggest that they conduct their own power calculation as it is too difficult to judge based on the figure alone. \n\nGenerally, if they want to be able to detect a medium-large effect with 90% power using $\\alpha = .05$, it appears that there is little gain in recruiting a sample size > ~110. However, if they want to be able to detect a small effect with 90% power using $\\alpha = .05$, they are likely going to require a very large sample size. \n\nTo summarise the association between effect size and sample size, it appears that the smaller the effect you are trying to detect, the larger the sample size you will require.\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Compile Report\n\n`r qbegin(\"Compile Report\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\nKnit your report to PDF, and check over your work. To do so, you should make sure:\n\n- Only the output you want your reader to see is visible (e.g., do you want to hide your code?)\n- Check that the **tinytex** package is installed\n- Ensure that the ‘yaml’ (bit at the very top of your document) looks something like this:\n\n```{}\n---\ntitle: \"this is my report title\"\nauthor: \"B1234506\"\ndate: \"07/09/2024\"\noutput: bookdown::pdf_document2\n---\n```\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n# What to do if you cannot knit to PDF\nIf you are having issues knitting directly to PDF, try the following:  \n\n- Knit to HTML file  \n- Open your HTML in a web-browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox)  \n- Print to PDF (Ctrl+P, then choose to save to PDF)  \n- Open file to check formatting\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n# Hiding Code and/or Output\n\n:::{.panel-tabset}\n## Hiding R Code\n\nTo not show the code of an R code chunk, and only show the output, write:\n\n````\n```{{r, echo=FALSE}}\n# code goes here\n```\n````\n\n## Hiding R Output\n\nTo show the code of an R code chunk, but hide the output, write:\n\n````\n```{{r, results='hide'}}\n# code goes here\n```\n````\n\n## Hiding R Code and Output\n\nTo hide both code and output of an R code chunk, write:\n\n````\n```{{r, include=FALSE}}\n# code goes here\n```\n````\n:::\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Tinytex\nYou must make sure you have **tinytex** installed in R so that you can “Knit” your Rmd document to a PDF file:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n\n`r solbegin(show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nYou should end up with a PDF file.
