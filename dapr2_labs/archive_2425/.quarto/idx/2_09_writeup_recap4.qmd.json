If you do not have a package and need to install, do so within the console using `install.packages(\" \")`. For further guidance on installing/updating packages, see Section C [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/files/install-update-r#update-pkgs). \n\nFor this lab, you will need to load the following package(s):\n\n* **tidyverse** \n* **patchwork**\n* **kableExtra**\n* **psych**\n* **sjPlot**\n\n### <i class=\"fa fa-file\"></i> Lab Data\n\nYou can download the data required for this lab [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv) or read it in via this link https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv\n:::\n\n# Section A: Write-Up\n\nIn this lab you will be presented with the output from a statistical analysis, and your job will be to write-up and present the results. We're going to use a simulated dataset based on a paper (the same that you have worked on in lectures this week) concerning delayed gratification and age.   \n\nThe aim in writing should be that a reader is able to more or less replicate your analyses **without** referring to your R code. This requires detailing all of the steps you took in conducting the analysis. The point of using RMarkdown is that you can pull your results **directly** from the code. If your analysis changes, so does your report!  \n\nMake sure that your final report doesn't show any R functions or code. Remember you are interpreting and reporting your results in text, tables, or plots, targeting a generic reader who may use different software or may not know R at all.

For example, some information is missing (e.g., description of data checks, interpretation of descriptive statistics), some information could be presented more clearly (e.g., variable names in tables, table/figure titles/captions, and rationales for choices), and writing could be more concise in places (e.g., discussion section could be more succinct and more focused on the research questions in places).  \n\nFurther, **you must not copy any of the write-up included below for future reports** - if you do, you will be committing plagiarism, and this type of academic misconduct is taken very seriously by the University.

The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\n\nMischel, W., Ebbesen, E. B., & Raskoff Zeiss, A. (1972). Cognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21*(2), 204–218. [https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198)\n\nIn the current study, a sample of 304 children, ranging in ages from 3 to 10 years old, took part. Each child was shown a marshmallow, and it was explained that they were about to be left alone for 10 minutes. They were told that they were welcome to eat the marshmallow while they were waiting, but if the marshmallow was still there after 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with **two** marshmallows.\n\nFor half of the children who took part, the marshmallow was visible for the entire 10 minutes (or until they ate it!). For the other half, the marshmallow was placed under a plastic cup.\n\nThe experiment took part at various times throughout the working day, and researchers were worried about children being more hungry at certain times of day, so they kept track of whether each child completed the task in the morning or the afternoon, so that they could control for this in their analyses.\n\nFor an example of the marshmallow experiment, watch the following video:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QX_oy9614HQ?si=xC0fAVA34i3ha_7L\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n\n\n__Data Dictionary__\n\nThe data in `mallow2.csv` contain five attributes collected from a simulated sample of $n=304$ hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nmarshmallow <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv\")\ntibble(\nVariable = names(marshmallow),\nDescription = c(\"Participant name\", \"Age (in months)\", \"Time of day that the experiment took place ('am' = morning, 'pm' = afternoon)\", \"Experimental condition - whether the marshmallow was 'visible' or 'hidden' for the 10 minutes\", \"Whether or not the participant took ('taken') the marshmallow within the 10 minutes or left it ('waited')\")\n) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv') %>%  head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n### Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`\n\n1.

Remember, your analysis strategy should **not** contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:  \n\n-  Very brief data and design description:\n     - Give the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\n     - Specify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (e.g., for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n-  Data management:  \n     - Describe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\n     - Are there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many? \n     - Describe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\n-  Model specification:  \n     -  Clearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\n     -  What type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\n     - In some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification. \n     -  Specify the model(s) equation you will fit to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data. \n     - Specify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these. \n     \nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see [Lesson 3 of the Rmd Bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/).\n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe `mallow2` dataset contained information on 304 participants who took part in a study concerning delayed gratification - where children were presented with a single marshmallow, but were told that if they could leave it for 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows (scored dichotomously as taken or waited). The children participated in either the morning (am) or afternoon (pm), and the marshmallow was either visible or hidden for the 10 minute duration of the experiment. The age of each child was also recorded. All participant data was complete (no missing values), but two participants were excluded due to their age being outside of the range included in the study, and one was excluded due to an inaccurate time of day recording. This resulted in a final sample size of 301.\n\nTo investigate whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day (am/pm), age, and marshmallow visibility (visible/hidden), a binary logistic regression model was used. Effects were considered statistically significant at $\\alpha = .05$. The following model specification was used:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Time of day}_\\text{PM} +  \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Visibility}_\\text{Hidden}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of taking the marshmallow}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nTo address the research question of whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility, this formally corresponded to:\n\n$$\nH_0: \\text{All} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ = ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n$$\n\n$$\nH_1: \\text{At least one} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ \\neq ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n$$\n\nTo assess how well the model fits the data, we visually assessed the standardized deviance residuals and Cook's Distance. We expected the former to identify outliers (or extreme values), and we expected residuals to fall within the range of -2 to 2. We used the latter to check for influential observations, and visually assessed if any of our 302 observations had a Cook's distance > 0.5 (moderately influential) or > 1 (highly influential).\n\n`r solend()`\n\n#### Act II: Results\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Results - What To Include\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics). \n\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and/or plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You do **not** want to overload the reader with *unnecessary* or *duplicate* information (e.g., do not present print outs of the head of a dataset, or the same information in tables and plots, etc.), and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can. You can also make use of an Appendix to present your assumption and diagnostic* plots/tables, but remember that you must evaluate these in-text within the results section and clearly refer the reader to the relevant plots within the Appendix. \n\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.  \n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Results Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in @tbl-descript.\n\n```{r descript, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, caption = \"Descriptives Table\"}\n#| label: tbl-descript\n#| tbl-cap: \"Descriptive Statistics\"\nmarshmallow %>% \n    group_by(visibility, timeofday) %>%\n   summarise(\n       M_Age = mean(age),\n       SD_Age = sd(age),\n       percent_taken = sum(taken==\"taken\")/n()*100) %>%\n  kable(caption = \"Descriptive Statistics\", digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling()\n```\n\nIt appeared that when the marshmallow was visible, a greater percentage of children took it; and the percentage of children who engaged in delayed gratification was higher in the morning sessions (see @fig-taken-plot).\n\n```{r takenplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = \"\", fig.align = \"center\"}\n#| label: fig-taken-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Association between Delayed Gratification, Age, Visibility of Marshmallow, and Time of Day\"\nggplot(data = marshmallow, aes(x = age, fill = as_factor(taken))) + \n  geom_density() + \n    facet_grid(visibility ~ timeofday) +\n    labs(x = \"Age\", fill = \"Marshmallow Status\")\n```\n\nA binary logistic regression model was fitted to determine whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility.\n\nOur model did not raise any concerns regarding outliers or high influence cases. Though there appeared to be a few residuals with a value slightly larger than 2 in absolute value (see left-hand plot in @fig-assumpt), they were not influential points (see right-hand plot in @fig-assumpt), since none of our observations had a Cook's distance value > 0.5.\n\n```{r assumpt, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = \"Assumption Checks\", fig.align = \"center\"}\n#| label: fig-assumpt\n#| fig-cap: \"Model Fit Plots\"\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(rstandard(mm1, type = \"deviance\"), ylab = \"Standardised Deviance Residuals\", ylim=c(-3.5, 3.5))\nplot(cooks.distance(mm1), ylab = \"Cook's Distance\", ylim=c(0, 0.04))\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres <- exp(car::Confint(mm1))\nres <- round(res,2)\n```\n\nAge and visibility were significant predictors of delayed gratification (see @tbl-res). For every year increase in age, the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of `r res[3,1]` ($95\\%\\, CI\\, [`r paste(res[3,2:3],collapse=\", \")`])$. When the marshmallow was hidden (as opposed to visible), the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of `r res[4,1]` ($95\\%\\, CI\\, [`r paste(res[4,2:3],collapse=\", \")`])$. Thus, we rejected the null hypothesis. \n\n```{r tableres, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, caption = \"Model Results\"}\n#| label: tbl-res\n#| tbl-cap: \"Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\"\ntab_model(mm1,\n          dv.labels = \"Marshmallow Taken\",\n          pred.labels = c(\"Intercept\", \"Time of Day - PM\", \"Age (in years)\", \"Visibility - Hidden\"),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\")\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n#### Act III: Discussion\n\n`r qbegin(3)`\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Discussion - What To Include\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question. \n\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe probability of children delaying gratification did change as a function of age and marshmallow visibility (but not time of day). In summary, older age and conditions where the marshmallow was hidden appeared to be associated with greater odds of successfully delaying gratification.\n\n`r solend()`\n\n# Section B: Block 4 (Weeks 6-9) Recap\n\nIn the second part of the lab, there is no new content - the purpose of the recap section is for you to revisit and revise the concepts you have learned over the last 4 weeks (or the full academic year if you feel that it would be beneficial to revise the materials from blocks 1, 2, and 3 too). \n\nWe would encourage you to complete any outstanding work on these exercises (e.g., complete partial write-ups), and review solutions. \n\nGiven that we have now covered all DAPR2 course content, we would also strongly encourage you to start creating your revision materials in advance of the exam.

You can find out more [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/conduct/academic-misconduct).\n:::\n\n## Study Overview\n\n> **Research Aim**\n> \n> Explore the associations among the ability to delay gratification and age, visibility, and time of day.\n\n> **Research Question**\n> \n> + Does the probability of delaying gratification change as a function of age, marshmallow visibility, and time of day?\n\n`r optbegin(\"Marshmallows: Data Codebook\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Description**\n\nThe data used for this write-up exercise are simulated, drawing on the Stanford marshmallow experiment - a study on delayed gratification in children. The simulated data are loosely based on the findings of this work, and acted to expand upon the methods and results reported in the paper:\n\nMischel, W., Ebbesen, E. B., & Raskoff Zeiss, A. (1972). Cognitive and attentional mechanisms in delay of gratification. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 21*(2), 204–218. [https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032198)\n\nIn the current study, a sample of 304 children, ranging in ages from 3 to 10 years old, took part. Each child was shown a marshmallow, and it was explained that they were about to be left alone for 10 minutes. They were told that they were welcome to eat the marshmallow while they were waiting, but if the marshmallow was still there after 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with **two** marshmallows.\n\nFor half of the children who took part, the marshmallow was visible for the entire 10 minutes (or until they ate it!). For the other half, the marshmallow was placed under a plastic cup.\n\nThe experiment took part at various times throughout the working day, and researchers were worried about children being more hungry at certain times of day, so they kept track of whether each child completed the task in the morning or the afternoon, so that they could control for this in their analyses.\n\nFor an example of the marshmallow experiment, watch the following video:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QX_oy9614HQ?si=xC0fAVA34i3ha_7L\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>\n\n\n__Data Dictionary__\n\nThe data in `mallow2.csv` contain five attributes collected from a simulated sample of $n=304$ hypothetical individuals, and includes:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nmarshmallow <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv\")\ntibble(\nVariable = names(marshmallow),\nDescription = c(\"Participant name\", \"Age (in months)\", \"Time of day that the experiment took place ('am' = morning, 'pm' = afternoon)\", \"Experimental condition - whether the marshmallow was 'visible' or 'hidden' for the 10 minutes\", \"Whether or not the participant took ('taken') the marshmallow within the 10 minutes or left it ('waited')\")\n) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/mallow2.csv') %>%  head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n### Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`\n\n1.

Remember, your analysis strategy should **not** contain any results. You may wish to include the following sections:  \n\n-  Very brief data and design description:\n     - Give the reader some background on the context of your write-up. For example, you may wish to describe the data source, data collection strategy, study design, number of observational units.\n     - Specify the variables of interest in relation to the research question, including their unit of measurement, the allowed range (e.g., for Likert scales), and how they are scored. If you have categorical data, you will need to specify the levels and coding of your variables, and what was specified as your reference level and the justification for this choice.\n\n-  Data management:  \n     - Describe any data cleaning and/or recoding.\n     - Are there any observations that have been excluded based on pre-defined criteria? How/why, and how many? \n     - Describe any transformations performed to aid your interpretation (i.e., mean centering, standardisation, etc.)\n\n\n-  Model specification:  \n     -  Clearly state your hypotheses and specify your chosen significance level.\n     -  What type of statistical analysis do you plan to use to answer the research question? (e.g., simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression, etc.)\n     - In some cases, you may wish to include some visualisations and descriptive tables to motivate your model specification. \n     -  Specify the model(s) equation you will fit to answer your given research question and analysis structure. Clearly specify the response and explanatory variables included in your model(s). This includes specifying the type of coding scheme applied if using categorical data. \n     - Specify the assumption and diagnostic checks that you will conduct. Specify what plots you will use, and how you will evaluate these. \n     \nAs noted and encouraged throughout the course, one of the main benefits of using RMarkdown is the ability to include inline R code in your document. Try to incorporate this in your write up so you can automatically pull the specified values from your code. If you need a reminder on how to do this, see [Lesson 3 of the Rmd Bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/).\n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Analysis Strategy Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe `mallow2` dataset contained information on 304 participants who took part in a study concerning delayed gratification - where children were presented with a single marshmallow, but were told that if they could leave it for 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows (scored dichotomously as taken or waited). The children participated in either the morning (am) or afternoon (pm), and the marshmallow was either visible or hidden for the 10 minute duration of the experiment. The age of each child was also recorded. All participant data was complete (no missing values), but two participants were excluded due to their age being outside of the range included in the study, and one was excluded due to an inaccurate time of day recording. This resulted in a final sample size of 301.\n\nTo investigate whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day (am/pm), age, and marshmallow visibility (visible/hidden), a binary logistic regression model was used. Effects were considered statistically significant at $\\alpha = .05$. The following model specification was used:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_1 &: \\qquad \\log \\left( \\frac{p}{1 - p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Time of day}_\\text{PM} +  \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Age} + \\beta_3 \\cdot \\text{Visibility}_\\text{Hidden}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{where}~{p}~ &=~ \\text{probability of taking the marshmallow}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nTo address the research question of whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility, this formally corresponded to:\n\n$$\nH_0: \\text{All} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ = ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n$$\n\n$$\nH_1: \\text{At least one} ~~ \\beta_j ~~ \\neq ~~ 0 ~~ (for ~~ j ~~ = 1, 2, 3)\n$$\n\nTo assess how well the model fits the data, we visually assessed the standardized deviance residuals and Cook's Distance. We expected the former to identify outliers (or extreme values), and we expected residuals to fall within the range of -2 to 2. We used the latter to check for influential observations, and visually assessed if any of our 302 observations had a Cook's distance > 0.5 (moderately influential) or > 1 (highly influential).\n\n`r solend()`\n\n#### Act II: Results\n\n`r qbegin(2)`\n\nAttempt to draft a results section based on your detailed analysis strategy and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Results - What To Include\n\nThe results section should follow from your analysis strategy. This is where you would present the evidence and results that will be used to answer the research questions and can support your conclusions. Make sure that you address all aspects of the approach you outlined in the analysis strategy (including the evaluation of assumptions and diagnostics). \n\nIn this section, it is useful to include tables and/or plots to clearly present your findings to your reader. It is important, however, to carefully select what is the key information that should be presented. You do **not** want to overload the reader with *unnecessary* or *duplicate* information (e.g., do not present print outs of the head of a dataset, or the same information in tables and plots, etc.), and you also want to save space in case there is a page limit. Make use of figures with multiple panels where you can. You can also make use of an Appendix to present your assumption and diagnostic* plots/tables, but remember that you must evaluate these in-text within the results section and clearly refer the reader to the relevant plots within the Appendix. \n\nAs a broad guideline, you want to start with the results of any exploratory data analysis, presenting tables of summary statistics and exploratory plots. You may also want to visualise associations between/among variables and report covariances or correlations. Then, you should move on to the results from your model.  \n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Results Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nDescriptive statistics are displayed in @tbl-descript.\n\n```{r descript, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, caption = \"Descriptives Table\"}\n#| label: tbl-descript\n#| tbl-cap: \"Descriptive Statistics\"\nmarshmallow %>% \n    group_by(visibility, timeofday) %>%\n   summarise(\n       M_Age = mean(age),\n       SD_Age = sd(age),\n       percent_taken = sum(taken==\"taken\")/n()*100) %>%\n  kable(caption = \"Descriptive Statistics\", digits = 2) %>%\n  kable_styling()\n```\n\nIt appeared that when the marshmallow was visible, a greater percentage of children took it; and the percentage of children who engaged in delayed gratification was higher in the morning sessions (see @fig-taken-plot).\n\n```{r takenplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = \"\", fig.align = \"center\"}\n#| label: fig-taken-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Association between Delayed Gratification, Age, Visibility of Marshmallow, and Time of Day\"\nggplot(data = marshmallow, aes(x = age, fill = as_factor(taken))) + \n  geom_density() + \n    facet_grid(visibility ~ timeofday) +\n    labs(x = \"Age\", fill = \"Marshmallow Status\")\n```\n\nA binary logistic regression model was fitted to determine whether the probability of taking the marshmallow changed as a function of time of day, age, and marshmallow visibility.\n\nOur model did not raise any concerns regarding outliers or high influence cases. Though there appeared to be a few residuals with a value slightly larger than 2 in absolute value (see left-hand plot in @fig-assumpt), they were not influential points (see right-hand plot in @fig-assumpt), since none of our observations had a Cook's distance value > 0.5.\n\n```{r assumpt, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = \"Assumption Checks\", fig.align = \"center\"}\n#| label: fig-assumpt\n#| fig-cap: \"Model Fit Plots\"\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nplot(rstandard(mm1, type = \"deviance\"), ylab = \"Standardised Deviance Residuals\", ylim=c(-3.5, 3.5))\nplot(cooks.distance(mm1), ylab = \"Cook's Distance\", ylim=c(0, 0.04))\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres <- exp(car::Confint(mm1))\nres <- round(res,2)\n```\n\nAge and visibility were significant predictors of delayed gratification (see @tbl-res). For every year increase in age, the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of `r res[3,1]` ($95\\%\\, CI\\, [`r paste(res[3,2:3],collapse=\", \")`])$. When the marshmallow was hidden (as opposed to visible), the odds of taking the marshmallow decreased by a factor of `r res[4,1]` ($95\\%\\, CI\\, [`r paste(res[4,2:3],collapse=\", \")`])$. Thus, we rejected the null hypothesis. \n\n```{r tableres, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, caption = \"Model Results\"}\n#| label: tbl-res\n#| tbl-cap: \"Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\"\ntab_model(mm1,\n          dv.labels = \"Marshmallow Taken\",\n          pred.labels = c(\"Intercept\", \"Time of Day - PM\", \"Age (in years)\", \"Visibility - Hidden\"),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Marshmallow Model\")\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n#### Act III: Discussion\n\n`r qbegin(3)`\n\nAttempt to draft a discussion section based on your results and the analysis provided.\n\n`r qend()`\n\n:::{.callout-tip appearance=\"simple\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\n### Discussion - What To Include\n\nIn the discussion section, you should summarise the key findings from the results section and provide the reader with a few take-home sentences drawing the analysis together and relating it back to the original question. \n\nThe discussion should be relatively brief, and should not include any statistical analysis - instead think of the discussion as a conclusion, providing an answer to the research question(s).\n\n:::\n\n`r solbegin(\": Example Write-Up of Discussion Section\", show = params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle = params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe probability of children delaying gratification did change as a function of age and marshmallow visibility (but not time of day). In summary, older age and conditions where the marshmallow was hidden appeared to be associated with greater odds of successfully delaying gratification.\n\n`r solend()`\n\n# Section B: Block 4 (Weeks 6-9) Recap\n\nIn the second part of the lab, there is no new content - the purpose of the recap section is for you to revisit and revise the concepts you have learned over the last 4 weeks (or the full academic year if you feel that it would be beneficial to revise the materials from blocks 1, 2, and 3 too). \n\nWe would encourage you to complete any outstanding work on these exercises (e.g., complete partial write-ups), and review solutions. \n\nGiven that we have now covered all DAPR2 course content, we would also strongly encourage you to start creating your revision materials in advance of the exam. You can access all the flashcards that you've been presented with in this block [here](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr2/2425/labs/1_b4_reading.html). These will provide a good starting point for collating your notes together on the contents of blocks 1, 2, 3, and 4. We also suggest that you review your weekly quiz feedback (as many of you have learned in Psychology 2A, it is important to provide feedback to allow learners to improve their learning and retention of information, as well as correct any misunderstandings!).\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-in-header":["assets/toggling.html",{"text":"<link
