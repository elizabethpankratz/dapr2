Although their original sample size was large $(n = 1324)$, they were interested in running separate logistic regression analyses within subgroups.

For your table of descriptive statistics, both the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions will come in handy here  \n  \n2.

When specifying `newdata = `, it might be useful to ask for each unique level of our \"Intention\" variable. This is very similar in procedure to how you've done this in the past.
