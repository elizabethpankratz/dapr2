On the other hand, the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will not significantly differ between patients with amnesia in comparison to controls. The researchers designed a study yielding a 3 by 2 factorial design to test this theory.   \n\nThe tasks chosen by the researchers have been picked to map onto the theoretical differences between the three types of research participants. The first task (grammar) is known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes. If the theory is correct, we would expect the difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks to be relatively similar for the control and amnesiac groups, but relatively larger for the Huntingtons group compared to controls.  \n\nKeep in mind that each person has been randomly assigned to one of the two tasks, so there are five observations per cell of the design.^[Some researchers may point out that a design where each person was assessed on both tasks might have been more efficient. However, the task factor in such design would then be within-subjects, meaning that the scores corresponding to the same person would be correlated. To analyse such design we will need a different method which (spoiler alert!) will be discussed next year in DAPR3.]  \n  \n__Data Dictionary__\n\nThe data in `cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv` contain three attributes collected from $n=30$ participants, and includes: \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncog <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv\")\ntibble(\nvariable = names(cog),\ndescription = c(\"Diagnosis classifies the three types of individuals: 1 = Amnesic patients, 2 = Huntingtons patients, and 3 = Control group of individuals with no known neurological disorder\", \"Task tells us to which one of two tasks each study participant was randomly assigned to: 1 = Grammar (which consists of classifying letter sequences as either following or not following grammatical rules), and 2 = Recognition (which consists of recognising particular stimuli as stimuli that have previously been presented during the task)\", \"Score\")) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n  \n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv') %>% head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\n1.

Participants belonged to one of three 'Diagnosis' groups, which had 10 participants in each - Control, Amnesic, or Huntingtons. Participants from each of the Diagnosis groups were randomly assigned to one of two 'Tasks' to measure different memory processes - Grammar or Recognition. For the purpose of this analysis, 'Control' was designated as the reference group for Diagnosis, since it was the only group of participants with no known neurological disorder, and as there is no natural reference group for Diagnosis, we chose to leave this as 'Grammar'.  \n\nBoxplots will be used to visualise the associations among Diagnosis and Task conditions.

On the other hand, the difference in performance between explicit and implicit memory tasks will not significantly differ between patients with amnesia in comparison to controls. The researchers designed a study yielding a 3 by 2 factorial design to test this theory.   \n\nThe tasks chosen by the researchers have been picked to map onto the theoretical differences between the three types of research participants. The first task (grammar) is known to reflect implicit memory processes, whereas the recognition task is known to reflect explicit memory processes. If the theory is correct, we would expect the difference in scores between the recognition and grammar tasks to be relatively similar for the control and amnesiac groups, but relatively larger for the Huntingtons group compared to controls.  \n\nKeep in mind that each person has been randomly assigned to one of the two tasks, so there are five observations per cell of the design.^[Some researchers may point out that a design where each person was assessed on both tasks might have been more efficient. However, the task factor in such design would then be within-subjects, meaning that the scores corresponding to the same person would be correlated. To analyse such design we will need a different method which (spoiler alert!) will be discussed next year in DAPR3.]  \n  \n__Data Dictionary__\n\nThe data in `cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv` contain three attributes collected from $n=30$ participants, and includes: \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\ncog <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv\")\ntibble(\nvariable = names(cog),\ndescription = c(\"Diagnosis classifies the three types of individuals: 1 = Amnesic patients, 2 = Huntingtons patients, and 3 = Control group of individuals with no known neurological disorder\", \"Task tells us to which one of two tasks each study participant was randomly assigned to: 1 = Grammar (which consists of classifying letter sequences as either following or not following grammatical rules), and 2 = Recognition (which consists of recognising particular stimuli as stimuli that have previously been presented during the task)\", \"Score\")) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n  \n__Preview__\n\nThe first six rows of the data are:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nread_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cognitive_experiment_3_by_2.csv') %>% head %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Setup\n\n`r qbegin(\"Setup\", qlabel = FALSE)`  \n\n1.
