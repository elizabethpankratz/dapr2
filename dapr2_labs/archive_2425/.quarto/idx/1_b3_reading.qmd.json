For such variables standard arithmetic operations make sense. For example: height, IQ, and weight |  \n| Categorical variable | A categorical variable places units into one of several groups. For example: country of birth, dominant hand, and eye colour |  \n| Binary variable | A special case of categorical variable with only 2 possible levels. For example: handedness (left or right), smoking status (smoker or non-smoker), pass test (yes or no) |  \n| Response variable (also more commonly called a dependent variable, or outcome variable) | Measures the outcome of interest in a study |  \n| Explanatory/independent variable (also called predictors) | Are used to explain differences/changes in the response variable |  \n| Observational study | An observational study is a study in which the researcher does not manipulate any of the variables involved in the study, but merely records the values as they naturally exist | \n| Experimental study | An experiment is a study in which the researcher imposes the values of the explanatory variable on the units before measuring the response variable |  \n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Data Exploration\n\nThe common first port of call for almost any statistical analysis is to explore the data, and we can do this visually and/or numerically.\n\n<table cellspacing=\"3\">\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\"><th></th><th style=\"border-right: 1px solid\">Marginal Distributions</th><th>Bivariate Associations</th></tr>\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\">\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">**Description**</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-right: 1px solid\">The distribution of each variable individually (i.e., *without* reference to the values of the other variables).</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Describing the association between two numeric variables.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\">\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">**Visually**</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-right: 1px solid\">Plot each variable individually.<br><br>You could use, for example, `geom_density()` for a density plot or `geom_histogram()` for a histogram to comment on and/or examine:<br><ul><li> The *shape* of the distribution.

Exploring our data numerically helps us to identify patterns and associations in the data.\n\n### Descriptives \n\n`r optbegin(\"Descriptives Tables\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThere are numerous packages available that allow us to pull out descriptive statistics from our dataset such as **tidyverse** and **psych**.\n\nWhen we pull out descriptive statistics, it is useful to present these in a well formatted table for your reader. There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the `kable()` function from the package **kableExtra**. \n\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via `caption = \"insert caption here\"`, align values within columns e.g., center aligned via `align = \"??\"`), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via `digits = ??`). \n\nWe can also add in the function `kable_styling()`. This is really helpful for customising your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!). \n\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see [Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/04-prettytab.html)\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Descriptives Tables - Examples\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n##### The **tidyverse** way\n\nWe can use the `summarise()` function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via `mean()`, standard deviation (via `sd()`), minimum value (via `min()`), maximum value (via `max()`), standard error (via `se()`), and skewness (via `skew()`). \n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric values only example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %>%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n## Categorical and numeric values example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# grouping by Species. NOTE: we can group by 2 variables - we would just separate by a comma within group_by( , )\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table of sepal length grouped by species with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %>%\n    group_by(Species) %>%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length (in cm) Grouped by Species Descriptives Table\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n##### The **psych** way\n\nThe `describe()` function will produce a table of descriptive statistics. If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use `select()` after calling `describe()` e.g., `describe() %>% select(mean, sd)`.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric values only example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\ndescribe(iris$Sepal.Length) %>%\n    select(mean, sd) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n## Categorical and numeric values options:\n\n*Note that this is quite an overly complex way to return these summary statistics - using the `tidyverse()` way is much more intuitive and straightforward!*\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column by Species\n# we want to return a matrix (hence mat = TRUE), then convert this to a dataframe\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a new column names of Group, Mean, SD; adding a caption; numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\n\n\ndescribeBy(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, mat = TRUE, digits = 2) %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  rownames_to_column() %>% \n  select(group1, mean, sd) %>%\n    kable(col.names = c(\"Group\", \"Mean\", \"SD\"), caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n#### Correlation\n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation Coefficient\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a standardised number which quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. In a population it is denoted by $\\rho$, and in a sample it is denoted by $r$. \n\nValues of $r$ fall between $-1$ and $1$. How to interpret:\n\n+ Size: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer $r$ is to $+/- 1$) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to $0$ a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n    + Weak = $.1 < |r| < .3$\n    + Moderate = $.3 < |r| < .5$\n    + Strong = $|r| > .5$\n    \n+ Direction: The sign of $r$ says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n    + Positive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\n    + Negative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation Matrix\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - $r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}$ - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).  \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the `cor()` function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables **must** be numeric.\n:::\n\nLet's check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\n```{r}\nstr(iris)\n```\n\nWe can see that the variable *Species* in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to *subset*, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside `[]`, or using `select()`. In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\n\nIf you had `NA` values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these `NA`s using `na.rm = TRUE` inside the `cor()` function.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Index dataframe (`[]`)\n\n```{r}\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n```\n\n## Variable selection (`select()`)\n\n```{r}\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %>% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %>%\n  cor() %>%\n  round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the _population_ parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., $\\rho$).  \n\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then... \n\n- $H_0: \\rho = 0$. There is _no_ linear association between $x$ and $y$ in the population.  \n- $H_1: \\rho \\neq 0$ There is a linear association between $x$ and $y$.  \n  \nIf we instead conduct a one-tailed test, then we are testing either...\n\n- $H_0: \\rho \\leq 0$ There is a negative or no linear association between $x$ and $y$   \n- $H_1: \\rho > 0$ There is a positive linear association between $x$ and $y$.\n\n**OR**\n\n- $H_0: \\rho \\geq 0$ There is a positive or no linear association between $x$ and $y$   \n- $H_1: \\rho < 0$ There is a negative linear association between $x$ and $y$.  \n\n__Test Statistic__  \n\nThe  test statistic for this test is the $t$ statistic, the formula for which depends on both the observed correlation ($r$) and the sample size ($n$):\n\n$$t = r \\sqrt{\\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}$$\n\n\n__p-value__  \n\nWe calculate the $p$-value for our $t$-statistic as the long-run probability of a $t$-statistic with $n-2$ degrees of freedom being less than, greater than, or more extreme in either direction (depending on the direction of our alternative hypothesis) than our observed $t$-statistic.  \n\n__Assumptions__  \n\nFor a test of Pearson's correlation coefficient $r$, we need to make sure a few conditions are met:  \n\n+ Both variables are quantitative (i.e., numeric)\n+ Both variables are drawn from normally distributed populations\n+ The association between the two variables is linear  \n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation - Hypothesis Testing in R\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nWe can test the significance of the correlation coefficient really easily with the function `cor.test()`:\n\n```{r}\ncor.test(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Petal.Length)\n```\n\nNote, by default, `cor.test()` will include only observations that have no missing data on either variable. \n\nWe can specify whether we want to conduct a one- or two-tailed test by adding the argument `alternative = ` and specifying `alternative = \"less\"`, `alternative = \"greater\"`, or `alternative = \"two.sided\"` (the latter being the default).  \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n**Example Interpretation**\n\nThere was a strong positive association between sepal length and petal length $(r = .87, t(148) = 21.65, p < .001)$. These results suggested that a greater sepal length was positively associated with a greater petal length. \n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nFor a detailed recap of all things correlation (including further details and examples), revisit the [Correlation lecture from DAPR1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1/2324/lectures/dapR1_lec20_Correlation.pdf).\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Visual Exploration\n\nVisual exploration of our data allows us to visualize the distributions of our data, and to identify potential associations between variables.\n\n`r optbegin(\"How to Visualise Data\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nTo visualise (i.e., plot) our data, we can use `ggplot()` from the **tidyverse** package. Note the key components of the `ggplot()` code:\n\n+ `data =` where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n+ `aes =` where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the $x$-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n+ `+ geom_...` = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in `aes()`.\n+ `labs()` = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the $x$- and $y$-axis)\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., `bins = `, `alpha = `, `fill = `, `linewidth = `. `linetype = `, `size = ` etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using `?` - e.g., `?fill`\n\nIf you'd like to read more about `ggplot()`, there is a handy [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).\n\n:::\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots. Some handy tips on this:  \n  \n- Use \\n to wrap text in your titles and or axis labels  \n- The **patchwork** package allows us to arrange multiple plots in two ways - `|` arranges the plots adjacent to one another, and `/` arranges the plots on top of one another  \n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Data Visualisation - Marginal Examples\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n#### Histogram\n\nA histogram shows the frequency of values which fall within bins of an equal width. \n\n**Basic:**\n\n- x-axis: possible values of some variable, grouped into bins\n- y-axis: frequency of a given value or values within bins\n- *What are bins?*: A bin represents a range of scores\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n\n**Updating Bins:**\n\nWithin `geom_histogram()`, we can specify `bins = ` to specify the number of columns we want (for this example, lets say we want 10):\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 10) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, we can specify `binwidth = ` to specify the width of each bin (it is very helpful to be aware of the scale of your variable here!):\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n\n**Outline columns with color:**\n\nWithin `geom_histogram()`, we can specify `color = ` to set a colored outline of the columns:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(color = \"red\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n\n**Fill columns with color:**\n\nWithin `geom_histogram()`, we can specify `fill = ` to fill the columns with a color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_histogram(fill = \"purple\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n#### Density\n\nA visualization of the distribution of a numeric variable. \n\n**Basic:**\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density() +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Filled:**\n\nWe can fill our plot with colour by specifying `fill = ` within `geom_density()`:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Line Type & Width:**\n\nWe can change the type and width of the line by specifying `linetype = ` and `linewidth = ` within `geom_density()`:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_density(linetype = 6, linewidth = 3) +\n    labs(x = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Data Visualisation - Bivariate Examples\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nUnlike in our marginal plots where we specified our x-axis variable within `aes()`, to visualise bivariate associations, we need to specify what variables we want on both our x- and y-axis. \n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n#### Scatterplot\n\nWe can use a scatterplot (since the variables are numeric and continuous) to visualise the association between the two numeric variables - these will be our x- and y-axis values. \n\nWe plot these values for each row of our dataset, and we should end up with a *cloud* of scattered points. \n\nHere we will want to comment on any key observations that we notice, including if we detect outliers or points that do not fit with the pattern in the rest of the data. Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n+ *marginally* along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n+ *jointly*: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud \n\n**Basic:**\n\nWe need to specify `+ geom_point()` to get a scatterplot: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Fill points with color:**\n\nWithin `geom_point()`, we can specify `color = ` to fill the points with a color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Change size and opacity:**\n\nWe can change the size (using `size =`) and the opacity (using `alpha =`) of our geom elements on the plot. Let’s include this below:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Add a line of best fit:**\n\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument `+ geom_smooth()`.

In this case, the perimeter is the dependent variable, and the side is the independent variable.\n\nThis is what we would refer to as a *deterministic model*, as it is a model of an *exact relationship* - there can be no deviation.\n\n**Model Specification**\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## In words\n\nThe perimeter of a square is four times the length of its side.\n\n\n## In symbols\n\nThe relationship between side and perimeter of squares is given by:\n\n$$\nPerimeter = 4 * Side\n$$\n\nIf you denote $y$ as the dependent variable _Perimeter_, and $x$ as the independent variable _Side_ we can rewrite as: \n\n$$\ny = 4 * x\n$$\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Deterministic Models - Visualisation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLet's create a dataset called `squares`, containing the perimeter of four squares having sides of length $0, 2, 5, 9$ meters, and then plot the `squares` data as points on a scatterplot. \n\nFirst, let's make our squares data. Here we will use two important functions - `tibble()` and `c()`. The `tibble()` function allows us to construct a data frame. To store a sequence of numbers into R, we can **c**ombine the values using `c()`. A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a *vector*.\n\n```{r}\n#create data frame named squares\nsquares <- tibble(\n  side = c(0, 2, 5, 9), \n  perimeter = 4 * side\n)\n\n#check that our values are contained within squares\nsquares\n```\n\nNow we know how `ggplot()` works, we can start to build our plot. First we specify our data (we want to use the *squares* data frame), and then our aesthetics. Since the perimeter varies as a function of side, we want side on the $x$-axis, and perimeter on the $y$-axis. We want to create a scatterplot, so we need to specify our `geom_...` argument as `geom_point()`.

To do so, we need to add a new argument - `geom_line()`. If you would like to change the colour of the line from the default, you can specify `geom_line(colour = \"insert colour name\")`. \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"blue\") + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Deterministic Models - Predicted Values\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nSometimes we can directly read a predicted value from the graph of the functional relationship.\n\nConsider the plot created above.

In our case, we would say a side of 2.5m corresponds to a perimeter of 10m. \n\nHowever, in this case it is not that easy to read it from the drawing...

By specifying a null hypothesis (typically stating no effect or no association) and an alternative hypothesis (indicating the presence of an association), we create a structured approach for determining the statistical significance of model parameters. Without specifying hypotheses, the interpretation of results would lack focus, making it difficult to assess the validity and relevance of the model's findings.\n\nIn regression analysis, hypothesis testing for beta coefficients is used to assess whether (each) predictor variable significantly contributes to the model. \n\nThe way we specify hypotheses is similar across simple and multiple regression models.\n\nFor each regression coefficient $\\beta_j$ (for predictor $X_j$):\n\n+ Null hypothesis ($H_0$) = $\\beta_j = 0$: The predictor variable ($X_j$) is not associated with the DV  \n+ Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) = $\\beta_j \\neq 0$: The predictor variable ($X_j$) is associated with the DV  \n  \n  \nBased on the $p$-value or comparison of the $t$-statistic with the critical value, you can conclude whether the predictor variable is significant or not (see the simple & multiple regression Models - extracting information > model coefficients flashcard below):\n\n+ Reject $H_0$ if $|t_j|$ > critical value or $p$-value $< \\alpha$ \n+ Fail to reject $H_0$ if $|t_j|$ $\\leq$ critical value or $p$-value $\\geq \\alpha$ \n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Simple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe association between two variables (e.g., recall accuracy and age) will show deviations from the 'average pattern'.

For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called \"tips\" (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\n```{r}\nstr(tips)\n```\n\nFrom the output, we can see that `Credit` (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a `<chr>` or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that `R` recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### `as_factor()`\n\n```{r}\ntips <- tips %>% \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n```\n\n### `factor()`\n\nWe could also use the `factor()` function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that *n* represents 'No' and *y* represents 'Yes'). To do so, we list the all levels of `Credit`, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ntips$Credit <- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n```\n\n:::\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run `str(tips)` again, you should see that `Credit` is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\n```{r}\nstr(tips)\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Binary Predictors\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as __dummy variables__.  \n\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\n\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels. \n\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in $y$ when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the **Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification** flashcard, specifically the section on interpretation of multiple regression coefficients).\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Categorical Predictors with k levels\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWhen we have a _categorical_ explanatory variable with __more than 2 levels__, our model gets a bit more complex - it needs not just one, but _a number of_ dummy variables. For a categorical variable with $k$ levels, we can express it in $k-1$ dummy variables.  \n\nFor example, the \"species\" column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables \"species_dog\" and \"species_parrot\": \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=\"80%\"}\ndata.frame(\n  species = c(\"cat\",\"cat\",\"dog\",\"parrot\",\"dog\",\"cat\",\"...\"),\n  species_dog = c(0,0,1,0,1,0,\"...\"),\n  species_parrot = c(0,0,0,1,0,0,\"...\")\n)\n```\n\n+ The \"cat\" level is expressed whenever both the \"species_dog\" and \"species_parrot\" variables are 0.\n+ The \"dog\" level is expressed whenever the \"species_dog\" variable is 1 and the \"species_parrot\" variable is 0.\n+ The \"parrot\" level is expressed whenever the \"species_dog\" variable is 0 and the \"species_parrot\" variable is 1.  \n\n`R` will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 3 different levels, the model will estimate 2 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using `coefficients()`,`coef()` or `summary()`) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal).  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(348)\ncatplot <- tibble(\n  species = rep(c(\"cat\",\"dog\",\"parrot\"), each = 15),\n  outcome = c(rnorm(15,60,5), rnorm(15,50,5), rnorm(15,55,5))\n)\ncstat = coef(lm(outcome~species,catplot))\npander::pander(summary(lm(outcome~species,catplot))$coefficients)\n```\n\nRecall that the intercept is the estimated outcome when all predictors are zero. In our example then, this represents the cat. We think of the \"cat\" category in this example as the _reference level_ - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. Therefore, in the above example, an increase in 1 of \"species_dog\" is the difference between a \"cat\" and a \"dog\". An increase in one of \"species_parrot\" is the difference between a \"cat\" and a \"parrot\". \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nggplot(catplot, aes(x=species, y=outcome))+\n  #geom_boxplot(fatten=NULL)+\n  geom_jitter(height=0,width=.05, alpha=.4)+\n  geom_point(x=1,y=cstat[1], col=\"blue\",size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=1,y=cstat[1],label=expression(paste(beta[0], \" (intercept)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=1.1)+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[2]),col=\"blue\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=2,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[2]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=2.15,y=mean(c(cstat[1],sum(cstat[1:2]))),label=expression(paste(beta[1], \" (slope)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=.35)+\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[3]),col=\"blue\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=3,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[3]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=3.15,y=mean(c(cstat[1],sum(cstat[c(1,3)]))),label=expression(paste(beta[2], \" (slope)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=.35)\n```\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Dummy vs Effects Coding\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n|       Name      |             Constraint            |             Meaning of $\\beta_0$            |         R         |\n|:---------------:|:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|\n| Sum to zero (Effects Coding) | $\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0$ | $\\beta_0 = \\mu$   |    `contr.sum`    |\n| Reference group (Dummy Coding) |           $\\beta_1 = 0$           | $\\beta_0 = \\mu_1$ | `contr.treatment` |\n\n\n**Dummy Coding**\n\nBy default `R` uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding  (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has $g$ levels, your regression model will have $g-1$ dummy variables (`R` creates them for you, as we've seen in the examples above). \n\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated $y$ when all predictors (i.e., $x$'s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\n\n\n**Effects Coding**\n\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\n\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average $y$ when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of $y$. The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**\n\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.sum\"\n```\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.treatment\"\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Categorical Predictors - Interpretation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLet's apply this to a different example - the iris dataset, and specifically, the Species categorical variable:\n\n```{r}\n#check what levels we have\nlevels(iris$Species)\n```\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Dummy Coding\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Species has 3 levels - \"setosa\", \"versicolor\", and \"virginica\". If we put these into a model, assuming `R`'s default ordering, we know that `R` will automatically apply dummy (or treatment coding), and \"setosa\" will be taken as our reference group:\n\n```{r}\n#fit model\nspec_model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model)\n```\n\nLet's first map our coefficients and estimates:\n\n| Coefficient | Estimate | Corresponds to |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| (Intercept)   |  5.0060 | $\\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu_1$\n| Speciesversicolor      | 0.9300  | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 = \\hat \\mu_2$ |\n| Speciesvirginica         | 1.5820  | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 = \\hat \\mu_3$ |\n\n+ The estimate corresponding to (Intercept) contains $\\hat \\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu_1 = 5.01$. The estimated average sepal length for the species setosa was approximately 5.01.\n\n+ The second estimate corresponds to `Speciesversicolor` and was $\\hat \\beta_1 = 0.93$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` and `versicolor` species was estimated to be $0.93~cm$. Thus, $\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 0.93 = 5.94$. We could say - the species iris versicolor had a sepal length of approximately 5.94cm, and this was approximately 0.93cm longer than the iris setosa. This difference was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n+ The third estimate corresponds to `Speciesvirginica` and was $\\hat \\beta_2 = 1.58$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` and `virginica` species was estimated to be $1.58~cm$. Thus, $\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 1.58 = 6.59$. We could say - the species iris virginica had a sepal length of approximately 6.59cm, and this was approximately 1.58cm longer than the iris setosa. This difference was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n### Effects Coding\n\nFirst we need to tell `R` to apply effects (or sum-to-zero) coding and check the ordering of the levels:\n\n```{r}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.sum\"\ncontrasts(iris$Species) \n```\n\nThen we can run our model:\n\n```{r}\n#fit model\nspec_model2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n```\n\n```{r echo = FALSE}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.treatment\"\ncontrasts(iris$Species) \n```\n\nLet's first map our coefficients and estimates:\n\n| Coefficient | Estimate | Corresponds to |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| (Intercept)   |  5.84333  | $\\beta_0 = \\frac{\\mu_1 + \\mu_2 + \\mu_3}{3} = \\mu$\n| Species1      | -0.83733  | $\\beta_1 = \\mu_1 - \\mu$|\n| Species2      | 0.09267   | $\\beta_2 = \\mu_2 - \\mu$ |\n\n+ The first estimate corresponding to (Intercept) contains $\\hat \\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu = 5.84$. The estimated average sepal length across iris species was approximately $5.84~cm$.\n\n+ The second estimate corresponds to `Species1` and was $\\hat \\beta_1 = -0.84$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` $(\\hat \\mu_1)$ and the grand mean $(\\hat \\mu_0)$  was estimated to be $0.84~cm$. In other words, the iris species of setosa had a sepal length $0.84~cm$ shorter than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 + (-0.83733) = 5~cm$. This difference in length was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n+ The third estimate corresponds to `Species2` and was $\\hat \\beta_2 = 0.09$. The difference in mean sepal length between `versicolor` $(\\hat \\mu_2)$ and the grand mean $(\\hat \\mu_0)$  was estimated to be $0.09~cm$. In other words, the iris species of versicolor had a sepal length $0.09~cm$ longer than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 + 0.09267 = 5.94~cm$. This difference in length was not statistically significant $(p = .121)$.\n\n+ The estimate for `Species3`, representing the difference of “virginica” to the grand mean is *not shown* by `summary()`. Because of the side-constraint, we know that $\\mu_3 = \\beta_0 - (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)$. The difference in sepal length between `virginica` and the grand mean was estimated to be $-(-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 0.74466$. In other words, the virginica iris species had a sepal length $0.74~cm$ longer than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 - (-0.83733  + 0.09267) = 6.59~cm$.  \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br>   \n\n`r optbegin(\"Specifying Reference Levels\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable coded as a factor, `R` will default to using alphabetical ordering - hence in our example above \"cat\" was the reference level (as opposed to \"dog\" or \"parrot\"), and in the other \"setosa\" was the reference level (as opposed to \"versicolor\" or \"virginica\").\n\nWe could override this by making it a factor with an ordering to it’s levels (see the use of `factor()` and `levels()`).

The larger our $t$-statistic, the more confident we can be that the coefficient is not 0. \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nIf you wanted to obtain just the $t$-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `coef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]`\n- `summary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]` \n\n:::\n\n### Pr(>|t|)\n\nFrom our $t$-value, we can compute our $p$-value.

The $p$-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a $t$-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\n\nIn Psychology, a $p$-value < .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your $\\alpha$ level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\n\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the 'Signif. codes' legend just under the coefficients section). \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nIf you wanted to obtain just the $p$-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `summary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]` \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## $\\sigma$\n\n```{r mlroutputresideror, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Multiple regression output in R, model standard deviation of the errors highlighted\", fig.align = 'left'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/recall_mdl_residerror.PNG\")\n```\n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by $\\sigma$, is an important quantity that our model estimates. It represents how much individual data points tend to deviate above and below the regression line - in other words, it tells us how well the model fits the data. \n\nA small $\\sigma$ indicates that the points hug the line closely and we should expect fairly accurate predictions, while a large $\\sigma$ suggests that, even if we estimate the line perfectly, we can expect individual values to deviate from it by substantial amounts.\n\nThe *estimated* standard deviation of the errors is denoted $\\hat \\sigma$, and is estimated by essentially averaging squared residuals (giving the variance) and taking the square-root: \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\hat \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - k - 1}} \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\\\\n& SS_{Residual} = \\textrm{Sum of Squared Residuals} = \\sum_{i=1}^n{(\\epsilon_i)^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nThere are a couple of equivalent ways to obtain the estimated standard deviation of the errors --- that is, $\\hat \\sigma$ --- from the fitted model (for this example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `sigma(mdl)`\n- `summary(mdl)`\n\n::: \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Manual Contrasts\n\nDummy and effects coding allow us to  test the significance of the difference between means of groups and some other mean (either reference group or grand mean respectively).

First, think back to [\"Type 1 errors\" from DAPR1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1/2324/lectures/dapr1_2_05_errorspower.pdf) - when we conduct an hypothesis test, and we set $\\alpha = .05$, we will reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ when we find a $p < .05$. Now remember what a $p$-value represents - it is the chance of observing a statistic at least as extreme as the one we do have, assuming the null hypothesis to be true. This means that *if* $H_0$ **is** true, then we will still observe a $p < .05$ 5\\% of the time. So our chance of making this error = the threshold ($\\alpha$) at which below a $p$-value results in us rejecting $H_0$. \n\nBut this error-rate applies to each statistical hypothesis we test. So if we conduct an experiment in which we plan on conducting lots of tests of different comparisons, the chance of an error being made increases substantially. Across the family of tests performed that chance will be much higher than 5\\%.^[what defines a 'family' of tests is debatable.]\n\nEach test conducted at $\\alpha = .05$ has a .05 (or 5%) probability of Type I error (wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis). If we do 9 tests, that experiment-wise error rate is $\\alpha_{ew} \\leq 9 \\times .05$, where 9 is the number of comparisons made as part of the experiment.\n\nThus, if nine **independent** comparisons were made at the $\\alpha = .05$ level, the experiment-wise Type I error rate $\\alpha_{ew}$ would be at most $9 \\times .05 = 0.45$. That is, we could wrongly reject the null hypothesis on average 45 times out of 100.  \n  \nTo make this more confusing, many of the tests in a family are not **independent** (see the lecture slides for the calculation of error rate for dependent tests).  \n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br>  \n\n`r optbegin(\"When to use Which Correction\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Bonferroni**  \n\n- Use Bonferroni’s method when you are interested in a small number of planned contrasts (or pairwise comparisons).\n- Bonferroni's method is to divide alpha by the number of tests/confidence intervals.\n- Assumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.  \n- It sacrifices slightly more power than Tukey’s method (discussed below), but it can be applied to any set of contrasts or linear combinations (i.e., it is useful in more situations than Tukey).\n- It is usually better than Tukey if we want to do a small number of planned comparisons.  \n\n**Šídák**  \n\n- (A bit) more powerful than the Bonferroni method.\n- Assumes that all comparisons are independent of one another. \n- Less common than Bonferroni method, largely because it is more difficult to calculate (not a problem now we have computers).  \n\n**Tukey**\n\n- It specifies an exact family significance level for comparing all pairs of treatment means.  \n- Use Tukey’s method when you are interested in all (or most) pairwise comparisons of means.  \n\n**Scheffe**\n\n- It is the most conservative (least powerful) of all tests.\n- It controls the family alpha level for testing all possible contrasts.\n- It should be used if you have not planned contrasts in advance.\n- For testing pairs of treatment means it is too conservative (you should use Bonferroni or Šídák).\n\n**Others**  \n  \n- In the wider literature, Holm's step-down and Hochberg's step-up mentioned.

The alternative hypothesis is that **at least one of the slopes is not zero**. \n\n\nThe $F$-ratio you see at the bottom of `summary(model)` is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting $y$) and the *null model*. \n\nIn regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the __intercept-only model__, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then we are only estimating $y$ via an intercept (which will be the mean - $\\bar y$). \n\n**Interpretation:** \n\nAlongside viewing the $F$-ratio, you can see the results from testing the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are $0$ (the alternative hypothesis is that at least one coefficient is $\\neq 0$. Under the null hypothesis that all coefficients = 0, the ratio of explained:unexplained variance should be approximately 1)\n\nIf your model predictors do explain some variance, the $F$-ratio will be significant, and you would reject the null, as this would suggest that your predictor variables included in your model improved the model fit (in comparison to the intercept only model).\n\n\n*Points to note:*\n\n- The larger your $F$-ratio, the better your model\n- The $F$-ratio will be close to 1 when the null is true (i.e., that all slopes are zero)\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**\n\nWe can see the $F$-statistic and associated $p$-value at the bottom of the output of `summary(<modelname>)`:\n\n```{r mlroutputf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Multiple regression output in R, F statistic highlighted\", fig.align = 'left'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/recall_mdl_output_f.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n**Example Interpretation**\n\nThe linear model with recall confidence and age explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond what we would expect by chance $F(2, 17) = 12.92, p < .001$. \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Overview:**\n\n$R^2$ represents the proportion of variance in $Y$ that is explained by the model predictor variables. \n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe $R^2$ coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model:\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}\n$$\n\nThe Adjusted $R^2$ coefficient is defined as:\n$$\n\\hat R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}\n\\quad \\\\\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n<br>\n\n**When to report Multiple $R^2$ vs. Adjusted $R^2$:**\n\nThe Multiple $R^2$ value should be reported for a simple linear regression model (i.e., one predictor).   \n\nUnlike $R^2$, Adjusted-$R^2$ does not necessarily increase with the addition of more explanatory variables, by the inclusion of a penalty according to the number of explanatory variables in the model.

This would allow us to check if the errors have a mean of zero. If this assumption was met, the residuals would appear to be randomly scattered around zero.  \n  \nThe rationale for this is that, once you remove from the data the linear trend, what's left over in the residuals should not have any trend, i.e. have a mean of zero.\n\n### Multiple Regression\nIn multiple regression, however, it becomes more necessary to rely on diagnostic plots of the model residuals. This is because we need to know whether the relations are linear between the outcome and each predictor _after accounting for the other predictors in the model._   \n\nIn order to assess this, we use **partial-residual plots** (also known as 'component-residual plots'). This is a plot with each explanatory variable $x_j$ on the x-axis, and **partial residuals** on the y-axis***.\n\nPartial residuals for a predictor $x_j$ are calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat \\epsilon + \\hat \\beta_j x_j\n$$\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Simple Linear Regression\n\n```{r}\n#specify model\nrecall_simp <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plot\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"blue\") + #fit straight line to data\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") + #fit loess line to data\n    labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Recall Accuracy\")\n\n```\n\n:::frame\n\n[**Interpretation Guidance**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\nThe loess line should closely follow the data.\n\n:::\n\n### Multiple Linear Regression\n\nWe can create these plots for all predictors in the model by using the `crPlots()` function from the **car** package:\n\n```{r}\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plots\ncrPlots(recall_mdl)\n```\n\n\n:::frame\n\n[**Interpretation Guidance**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\nYou are looking for the pink line to follow a linear trend line (i.e., follow the blue line).

It is important to be familiar with your dataset, as you need to know what values are typical, normal, and possible. Could it be the case that you have missed some impossible values (e.g., a negative value of a persons height), values outwith the possible range (e.g., a score of 55 on a survey where scores can only range 10-50), values that don't make any sense (e.g., an age of 200), or maybe there are even typos / data entry errors (e.g., forgetting to put a decimal point, so having a height of 152m instead of 1.52m)! \n\nIf there is a simple error in the data, it could be that you can fix the typo. If that is not possible (maybe you didn't collect the data, so are unsure of what the value(s) should/could be), you will need to delete the value (i.e., set as an `NA`), because you know that it is incorrect. \n\nWe should aim to never change a legitimate value where possible (and remember that if you have a large dataset, a small number of extreme values will be unlikely to have a strong influence on your results). \n\nIf there is an extreme, but legitimate value that you have determined is adversely influencing your model (i.e., by examining the assumptions and diagnostics as outlined above), you may want to consider ways to reduce this influence (e.g., **winsorizing** -  which essentially truncates or caps the identified extreme values to a specified percentile, in turn reducing their influence on the model without completely eliminating the observation(s). For example, you could replace values below the 5th percentile with the 5th percentile value, and values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value).\n\nIf after re-examining your data you cannot identify any atypical, non-normal, or impossible values, you may need to select a different approach as outlined below. \n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThis allows us to assess the **sensitivity** of our results (i.e., parameter estimates, p-values, confidence intervals) to changes in our modelling approach (i.e., the removal of observations).\n\nWe can re-fit our model after excluding our identified outliers and potentially influential observations, and compare these results to the original model.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false collapse=true}\n\n# Process of Removing Observations\n\nThe current example involves removing all identified outliers and potentially influential observations at the same time. Ideally, and to ensure a more thorough sensitivity analysis, you would remove each of these observations one at a time, assess the effects on the model by comparing to your original, reassessing the remaining pre-identified observations, and repeating the process if necessary. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Original Model\n\n```{r}\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata) \nsummary(wb_mdl1)\n```\n\n\n### Model with Observations Removed\n\n```{r}\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ])\nsummary(wb_mdl2)\n```\n\n\n### Compare `summary()` output\n\n```{r}\ntab_model(wb_mdl1, wb_mdl2,\n          dv.labels = c(\"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\", \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\"),\n          pred.labels = c(\"outdoor_time\" = \"Outdoor Time (hours per week)\",\n                          \"social_int\" = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\"),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Wellbeing Models wb1 and wb2\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how robust our conclusions were regarding outdoor time and the weekly number of social interactions in the presence of previously identified outliers and potentially influential observations. We re-fit the model, excluding these 28 observations (14% of our original sample), and compared these model results (`wb_mdl2`) to those of our original model (`wb_mdl1`). \n\nThere was little difference in the estimates from `wb_mdl1` and `wb_mdl2`, and so we can conclude that after conducting a sensitivity analysis, there were no meaningful differences in our results, and hence our conclusions from our original model hold. Specifically:\n\n+ The direction of all model estimates are the same in `wb_mdl1` and `wb_mdl2` (i.e., all positive)\n+ There is no difference in statistical significance, and the p-values were of a similar magnitude (i.e., all < .001)\n+ The estimate and confidence intervals for `outdoor_time` are very similar\n+ There are some quantitative differences in the estimate and confidence intervals for `social_int`. The estimate differs slightly in magnitude by 0.07), but given that this remains positive and significant, we do not need to be too concerned about this. \n\n:::\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nThe bootstrap method is an alternative non-parametric method of constructing a standard error. Instead of having to rely on calculating the standard error with a formula and potentially applying fancy mathematical corrections, bootstrapping involves mimicking the idea of “repeatedly sampling from the population”. It does so by repeatedly **re**sampling with **replacement** from our original sample.\n\nWhat this means is that we don’t have to rely on any assumptions about our model residuals, because we actually generate an actual distribution that we can take as an approximation of our sampling distribution, meaning that we can actually look at where 95% of the distribution falls, without having to rely on any summing of squared deviations.\n\nNote, the bootstrap may provide us with an alternative way of conducting inference, but our model may still be mis-specified. It is also very important to remember that bootstrapping is entirely reliant on utilising our original sample to pretend that it is a population (and mimic sampling from that population). If our original sample is not representative of the population that we’re interested in, bootstrapping doesn’t help us at all.\n\n## OLS vs WLS Regression\n\nThe method of ordinary least squares regression (OLS: i.e., the type of regression model you have been fitting on the course) assumes that there is constant variance in the errors (*homoscedasticity*). The method of weighted least squares (WLS) can be used when the ordinary least squares assumption of constant variance in the errors is violated (i.e., you have evidence of *heteroscedasticity*, like we do in Q3 of this lab).\n\nIf we have some specific belief that your non-constant variance is due to differences in the variances of the outcome between various groups, then it might be better to use Weighted Least Squares.   \n\nAs an example, imagine we are looking at weight of different dog breeds (@fig-dogweight). The weights of chihuahuas are all quite close together (between 2 to 5kg), but the weight of, for example, spaniels is anywhere from 8 to 25kg - a much bigger variance. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-dogweight\n#| fig-cap: \"The weights of 49 dogs, of 7 breeds\"\nset.seed(4)\ndf <- tibble(\n  breed = c(\"chihuahua\",\"boxer\",\"pug\",\"spaniel\",\"golden retriever\",\"beagle\",\"lurcher\"),\n  m = c(8,70,18,24,70,30,45),\n  sd = c(2,10,6,24,15,8,5)\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    weight = map2(m,sd, ~rnorm(7,.x,.y)*0.454)\n  ) |> select(breed,weight) |> unnest(cols = c(weight))\ndf$breed = factor(df$breed, levels=c(\"beagle\",\"pug\",\"spaniel\",\"chihuahua\",\"boxer\",\"golden retriever\",\"lurcher\"))\ndogdf<-df\n#save(dogdf, file=\"../../uoepsy/data/dogweight.RData\")\n\n\ndf_ms = df |> group_by(breed) |> summarise(m = round(mean(weight),1))\nggplot(df, aes(x=breed,y=weight))+\n  geom_boxplot(fatten = NULL) + \n  stat_summary(geom=\"segment\", \n               mapping=aes(xend=..x..-.375,yend=..y..,col=breed)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"segment\", \n               mapping=aes(xend=..x..+.375,yend=..y..,col=breed)) + \n  geom_label(data=df_ms,aes(label=m,y=m,col=breed))+\n  guides(col=\"none\") +\n  labs(x=\"Dog Breed\",y=\"Weight (kg)\")\n\n```\n\nRecall that the default way that `lm()` deals with categorical predictors such as `dog breed`, is to compare each one to a reference level. In this case, that reference level is \"beagle\" (first in the alphabet). Looking at @fig-dogweight above, which comparison do you feel more confident in? \n\n- **A:** Beagles (14kg) vs Pugs (9.1kg). A difference of 4.9kg.  \n- **B:** Beagles (14kg) vs Spaniels (19kg). A difference of 5kg.  \n\nHopefully, your intuition is that **A** looks like a clearer difference than **B** because there's less overlap between Beagles and Pugs than between Beagles and Spaniels. Our standard linear model, however, assumes the standard errors are identical for each comparison:  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ndogmodel <- lm(weight~breed, dogdf)\n.pp(summary(dogmodel),l = list(3,9:18))\n```\n\nFurthermore, we can see that we have heteroscedasticity in our residuals - the variance is not constant across the model:  \n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 3\nplot(dogmodel, which=3)\n```\n\nWeighted least squares is a method that allows us to apply weights to each observation, where the size of the weight indicates the precision of the information contained in that observation.  \n\nWe can, in our dog-breeds example, allocate different weights to each breed. Accordingly, the Chihuahuas are given higher weights (and so Chihuahua comparisons result in a smaller SE), and Spaniels and Retrievers are given lower weights. \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(nlme)\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/dogweight.RData\"))\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, \n                 weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\nsummary(dogmod_wls)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nlibrary(nlme)\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\n.pp(summary(dogmod_wls),l = list(16:25))\n```\n\nWe _can_ also apply weights that change according to continuous predictors (e.g. observations with a smaller value of $x$ are given more weight than observations with larger values). \n\n## Data Transformations\n\nA data transformation involves the replacement of a variable (e.g., $y$) by a function of that variable in order to change the shape of a distribution or association (e.g., to help reduce skew). We can transform the outcome variable prior to fitting the model, using something such as `log(y)` or `sqrt(y)`. This will sometimes allow us to estimate a model for which our assumptions are satisfied.\n\nSome of the most common (not an exhaustive list) transformations are:\n\n+ **Log (`log(y)`)**: Often used for reducing right skewness. Note, this transformation cannot be applied to zero or negative values (make sure to check your data!)\n+ **Square root (`sqrt(y)`)**: Also often used for reducing right skewness. This transformation can be applied to zero values (but not negative), and is commonly applied to count data\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-trouble1\n#| fig-cap: \"A model of a transformed outcome variable can sometimes avoid violations of assumptions that arise when modeling the outcome variable directly. Data from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\"\n\n# set.seed(4)\n# df <- tibble(\n#   x = runif(100,1,100),\n#   ly = x*.01 + rnorm(100),\n#   y = exp(ly)\n# )\n# write_csv(df %>% select(x,y), file=\"../../uoepsy/data/trouble1.csv\")\ndf <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\") |> mutate(ly=log(y))\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nhist(df$y, breaks=30, main=\"marginal distribution of y\",xlab=\"y\")\nwith(df,plot(y~x, main=\"lm(y ~ x)\\nassumptions violated\",xlab=\"x\",ylab=\"y\"))\nabline(lm(y~x,df),col=\"red\")\nhist(df$ly,  breaks=30, main=\"marginal distribution of log(y)\",xlab=\"log(y)\")\nwith(df,plot(ly~x, main=\"lm(log(y) ~ x)\\nassumptions satisfied\",xlab=\"x\",ylab=\"log(y)\"))\nabline(lm(ly~x,df),col=\"red\")\n```\n\nThe major downside of this is that we are no longer modelling $y$, but some transformation $f(y)$ ($y$ with some function $f$ applied to it). Interpretation of the coefficients changes accordingly, such that we are no longer talking in terms of changes in y, but changes in $f(y)$. When the transformation function used is non-linear (see the Right-Hand of @fig-logtr) a change in $f(y)$ is **not the same** for every $y$. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-logtr\n#| fig-cap: \"The log transformation is non-linear\"\n#| fig-height: 3.5\n#| echo: false\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nwith(df,plot(y,2*y,main=\"y and 2*(y)\",xlab=\"y\",ylab=\"2(y)\"))\nwith(df,plot(y,ly,main=\"y and log(y)\",xlab=\"y\",ylab=\"log(y)\"))\n```\n\nFor certain transformations, we _can_ re-express coefficients to be interpretable with respect to $y$ itself. For instance, the model using a log transform $ln(y) = b_0 + b_1(x)$ gives us a coefficient that represents statement __A__ below. We can re-express this by taking the opposite function to logarithm, the exponent, `exp()`. Similar to how this works in logistic regression, the exponentiated coefficients obtained from `exp(coef(model))` are _multiplicative_, meaning we can say something such as statement __B__\n\n:::int\n\n- __A:__ \"a 1 unit change in $x$ is associated with a $b$ unit change in $ln(y)$\".  \n- __B:__ \"a 1 unit change in $x$ is associated with $e^b$ __percent__ change in $y$.\"\n\n:::\n\nFinding the optimal transformation to use can be difficult, but there are methods out there to help you. One such method is the BoxCox transformation, which can be conducted using `BoxCox(variable, lambda=\"auto\")`, from the __forecast__ package.^[This method finds an appropriate value for $\\lambda$ such that the transformation $(sign(x) |x|^{\\lambda}-1)/\\lambda$ results in a close to normal distribution.] \n\n## Using Non-Linear Models\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Generalized Linear Models\n\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) can appropriately deal with data that do not follow a normal distribution (which is a requirement for traditional linear models). They can accommodate various types of distributions, including the Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. This makes them suitable for modelling count data (e.g., number of sunny days Edinburgh has per year - yes, count data can include 0!), binary data (where there are only two possible values e.g., doesn't wear glasses vs wear glasses, smoker vs non-smoker, i.e., values that are yes/no or 0/1), and other types of non-normal data.\n\nWe will explore some GLMs later in the course (Semester 2 Block 4), where we will work with logistic regression models. \n\n### Higher Order Terms\n\nHigher order regression terms refer to the inclusion of polynomial terms of degree higher than one in a regression model. In a linear regression model, the association between the dependent variable ($Y$) and the independent variable ($X$) is assumed to be linear, which means the association can be represented by a straight line. However, in many real-world scenarios, associations between variables are not strictly linear, and including higher order regression terms can help capture more complex relationships. Higher order terms that you could incorporate include quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial terms. \n\nFor example, in a quadratic regression model, the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ can be represented as:\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^2 + \\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& Y = \\text{Dependent Variable} \\\\\n& X = \\text{Independent Variable} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAs in our models we've seen so far, $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, and $\\beta_2$ are the coefficients to be estimated in the above model. What is different from what we've seen in DAPR2 is the term $\\beta_2 \\cdot X^2$, and this represents the *quadratic term*. This allows for a curved as opposed to straight line to represent the association between $Y$ and $X$, and hence can allow us to capture more complex relationships. For example, we can model the association between height and age:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-nonlin\n#| fig-cap: \"Two linear models, one with a quadratic term (right)\"  \n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nset.seed(13)\ndf <- tibble(\n  age = sample(0:16,100,replace=T),\n  height = 70 + (7*age) - (17*scale(age)^2) + rnorm(100,0,10)\n)\nmod1 <- lm(height ~ age, data = df)\nmod2 <- lm(height ~ age + I(age^2), data = df)\ndf <- df %>% mutate(f1 = fitted(mod1),f2=fitted(mod2))\n\np1 <- ggplot(df,aes(x=age,y=height)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y=f1),lwd=1, col=\"blue\")  +\n  labs(title=\"Simple Linear Model\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 12)\n\np2 <- ggplot(df,aes(x=age,y=height)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y=f2),lwd=1,col=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title=\"Quadratic Model\") +    \n  theme_bw(base_size = 12)\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nPlease note that these types of models are beyond the scope of the DAPR2 course, but if you want to know more, please do read up on these in your own time. \n:::\n\n## Removing Observations\n\nRemoving outliers and potentially influential observations should be a last resort - not all outliers are inherently 'bad' - we do expect natural variation in our population(s) of interest. Outliers can be informative about the topic under investigation, and this is why you need to be very careful about excluding outliers due only to their 'extremeness'. In doing so, you can distort your results by removing variability - i.e., by forcing the data to be more normal and less variable than it actually is, and reduce statistical power by reducing the size of your sample. \n\nIf you do decide to remove observations, you will need to document what specific data points you excluded, and provide an explanation as to why these were excluded. \n\nTo set specific values to `NA` in our dataset (and save this updated dataset in a new object named `mwdata2`), we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to set any `age` values of <20 as `NA`. In the original dataset `mwdata`, we had 3 individuals aged 18, and 6 aged 19, so we should end up with 9 `NA` values in `mwdata2` column `age`:\n\n```{r}\n#specify age column in original dataset, where age is < 20, for values to be set to NA and save to new object named mwdata2 to avoid overwriting original data\nmwdata2 <-  mwdata %>% \n    mutate(age = replace(age, age < 20, NA))\n\n#check how many NA values we have - there should be 9 (so 9 TRUEs):\ntable(is.na(mwdata2$age))\n```\n\nIf we wanted to remove a full row from the datset, we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to remove all rows that were highlighted in the above assumption and diagnostic checks as potentially having an adverse influence on our model estimates:\n\n```{r}\n# create new dataset 'mwdata3' without (by specifying -) identified outliers and potentially influential observations\nmwdata3 <- mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ]\n\n# check dimensions - should now have 32 rows less than original dataset 200 - 32 = 168\ndim(mwdata3)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Bootstrap\n\nThe _bootstrap_ is a general approach to assessing whether the sample results are statistically significant or not, and allows us to draw inferences to the population from a regression model. This method is assumption-free and does not rely on conditions such as normality of the residuals.\n\nIt is based on sampling repeatedly with replacement (to avoid always getting the original sample exactly) from the data at hand, and then computing the regression coefficients from each re-sample. We will equivalently use the word \"bootstrap sample\" or \"resample\" (for **sample** with **re**placement).\n\n`r optbegin(\"Overview\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe basic principle is:\n\n<center>\n__The population is to the original sample__\n\n__as__\n\n__the original sample is to the bootstrap samples.__\n\n</center>\n\n\nBecause we only have one sample of size $n$, and we do not have access to the data for the entire population, we consider our original sample as our best approximation to the population. \n\nTo be more precise, we assume that the population is made up of many, many copies of our original sample. Then, we take multiple samples each of size $n$ from this assumed population. This is equivalent to sampling _with replacement_ from the original sample.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}\nknitr::include_graphics('images/reg-boot.png')\n```\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Terminology\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n- A _parameter_ is a numerical summary for the population, e.g. the population slope $\\beta_1$.\n- A _statistic_ is a numerical summary calculated from the sample data, e.g. the estimated slope in the sample $\\widehat \\beta_1$. We use the sample statistic as a best guess, or estimate, for the unknown population parameter.\n- A _bootstrap sample_ is chosen with replacement from an existing sample, using the same sample size.\n- A _bootstrap statistic_ is a statistic computed for each bootstrap sample.\n- A _bootstrap distribution_ collects bootstrap statistics for many bootstrap samples.\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"In R\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n* 1: Load the **car** package.    \n  \n* 2: Use the `Boot()` function (do not forget the uppercase B!) which takes as arguments:\n    - the fitted model\n    - `f`, saying which bootstrap statistics to compute on each bootstrap sample. By default `f = coef`, returning the regression coefficients.\n    - `R`, saying how many bootstrap samples to compute. By default `R = 999` but this could be any number. To experiment we recommend 1000, when you want to produce results for journals, it is typical to go with 10,000 or more.\n    - `ncores`, saying if to perform the calculations in parallel (and more efficiently). However, this will depend on your PC, and you need to find how many cores you have by running `parallel::detectCores()` on your PC. By default the function uses `ncores = 1`.  \n     \n* 3: Run the code. However, please remember that the `Boot()` function does **not** want a model which was fitted using data with `NAs`. To remove, for example, you could use `na.omit`.  \n  \n* 4: Look at the `summary()` of the bootstrap results. When doing so the output will show, for each regression coefficient, the value in the original sample in the column `original`, and in the `bootSE` column, the estimate of the variability of the coefficient from bootstrap sample to bootstrap sample. The `bootSE` provides us the bootstrap standard error, or bootstrap SE in short. We can use this to answer the key question of how accurate our estimate is. \n  \n* 5: Compute confidence intervals via the `Confint()` function. Use your preferred confidence level (usually, and by default, 95%) by specifying `level = `. If you select 95% confidence intervals, by also specifying the `type = \"perc\"` argument, `R` will return the values that comprise 95% of all values in between them, i.e. the value with 2.5% of observations below it and the value with 2.5% of observations above it and 97.5% of observations below it.  \n  \n* 6: Provide interpretation in the context of your research question and report results in APA format. *(Note: the actual estimates are those from our original model, it is just the bounds of the interval that bootstrapping is providing us with)*. \n\n:::blue\n\n**In R**\n\n```{r}\n\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#step 1: load car package\nlibrary(car)\n\n#step 2/3: bootstrap model (asking to resample 1000 times, i.e., getting a distribution of 1000 values for the coefficients)\nbootmymodel <- Boot(recall_mdl, R = 1000)\n\n#step 4: check summary\nsummary(bootmymodel)\n\n#step 5: confidence intervals\nConfint(bootmymodel, level = 0.95, type = \"perc\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Visualisation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nYou can visualise the uncertainty in the estimates by plotting histograms using the built-in function from the **car** package, which simply takes the bootstrap results `bootmymodel`.

This means that it also applies to how you present results in your Psychology courses, including DAPR2.\n\n`r optbegin(\"APA Formatting Guides\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nAll results should be presented following [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf). \n\nYou also need to follow APA style rules for [tables and figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures). \n\nMake sure to familiarise yourself with the above guides, and practice presenting your results following these rules.\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Tables\n\nWe want to ensure that we are presenting results in a well formatted table. To do so, there are lots of different packages available (see [Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/04-prettytab.html)). \n\nOne of the most convenient ways to present results from regression models is to use the `tab_model()` function from **sjPlot**\n\n`r optbegin(\"Creating tables via tab_model\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWithin `tab_model()`, there are lots of different ways that you can customise your table. The most common arguments that you should use are `dv.labels`, `pred.labels`, and `title`. \n\nYou can rename your DV and IV labels by specifying `dv.labels` and `pred.labels`. To do so, specify your variable name on the left, and what you would like this to be named in the table on the right. For `title`, you can simply specify in \"\"'s what you want your title to be e.g., `title = \"This is my title\"`. \n\nHere's an example if I had fitted a model with the following information:\n\n- Model name = `mdl_test`\n- Model DV = `cognitive_score`\n- Model IVs = `SES` and `age`\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nmdl_test <- lm(cognitive_score ~ SES + age, data = data_name)\n```\n\nI want to change the names of `SES` and `age` to be `socio-economic status` and `age - in years` respectively. What we need to pay attention to here is the ordering of the IVs - the ordering in our `lm()` must match that in `tab_model()`.

For such variables standard arithmetic operations make sense. For example: height, IQ, and weight |  \n| Categorical variable | A categorical variable places units into one of several groups. For example: country of birth, dominant hand, and eye colour |  \n| Binary variable | A special case of categorical variable with only 2 possible levels. For example: handedness (left or right), smoking status (smoker or non-smoker), pass test (yes or no) |  \n| Response variable (also more commonly called a dependent variable, or outcome variable) | Measures the outcome of interest in a study |  \n| Explanatory/independent variable (also called predictors) | Are used to explain differences/changes in the response variable |  \n| Observational study | An observational study is a study in which the researcher does not manipulate any of the variables involved in the study, but merely records the values as they naturally exist | \n| Experimental study | An experiment is a study in which the researcher imposes the values of the explanatory variable on the units before measuring the response variable |  \n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Data Exploration\n\nThe common first port of call for almost any statistical analysis is to explore the data, and we can do this visually and/or numerically.\n\n<table cellspacing=\"3\">\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\"><th></th><th style=\"border-right: 1px solid\">Marginal Distributions</th><th>Bivariate Associations</th></tr>\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\">\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">**Description**</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-right: 1px solid\">The distribution of each variable individually (i.e., *without* reference to the values of the other variables).</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">Describing the association between two numeric variables.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid\">\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top\">**Visually**</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;border-right: 1px solid\">Plot each variable individually.<br><br>You could use, for example, `geom_density()` for a density plot or `geom_histogram()` for a histogram to comment on and/or examine:<br><ul><li> The *shape* of the distribution.

There are lots of different ways of doing this, but one of the most common (and straightforward!) is to use the `kable()` function from the package **kableExtra**. \n\nThis allows us to give our table a clear caption (via `caption = \"insert caption here\"`, align values within columns e.g., center aligned via `align = \"??\"`), and we can also round to however many decimal places we desire (standard for APA is 2 dp; via `digits = ??`). \n\nWe can also add in the function `kable_styling()`. This is really helpful for customising your table e.g., the font size, position, and whether or not you want the table full width (as well as lots of other things - check out the helper function!). \n\nFor an overview of how to make tables in RMarkdown, see [Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/04-prettytab.html)\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Descriptives Tables - Examples\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n##### The **tidyverse** way\n\nWe can use the `summarise()` function to numerically summarise/describe our data. Some key values we may want to consider extracting are (though not limited to): the mean (via `mean()`, standard deviation (via `sd()`), minimum value (via `min()`), maximum value (via `max()`), standard error (via `se()`), and skewness (via `skew()`). \n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric values only example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# taking the mean and standard deviation of sepal length via the summarize function\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\niris %>%\n    summarize(\n        M_Length = mean(Sepal.Length),\n        SD_Length = sd(Sepal.Length)\n    ) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n## Categorical and numeric values example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# grouping by Species.

If you would like only a subset of this output (e.g., mean, sd), you can use `select()` after calling `describe()` e.g., `describe() %>% select(mean, sd)`.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Numeric values only example:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a caption, where numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\ndescribe(iris$Sepal.Length) %>%\n    select(mean, sd) %>%\n    kable(caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n## Categorical and numeric values options:\n\n*Note that this is quite an overly complex way to return these summary statistics - using the `tidyverse()` way is much more intuitive and straightforward!*\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n# using the pre-loaded iris dataset\n# we want to get descriptive statistics of the iris dataset, specifically the sepal length column by Species\n# we want to return a matrix (hence mat = TRUE), then convert this to a dataframe\n# we specifically want to select the mean and standard deviation from the descriptive statistics available (try this without including this argument to see what values you all get out)\n# returning a table with a new column names of Group, Mean, SD; adding a caption; numbers are rounded to 2 dp\n# asking for a table that is not the full width of the window display\n\n\ndescribeBy(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, mat = TRUE, digits = 2) %>%\n  as.data.frame() %>%\n  rownames_to_column() %>% \n  select(group1, mean, sd) %>%\n    kable(col.names = c(\"Group\", \"Mean\", \"SD\"), caption = \"Sepal Length Descriptives (in cm)\", digits = 2) %>%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n#### Correlation\n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation Coefficient\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe correlation coefficient is a standardised number which quantifies the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. In a population it is denoted by $\\rho$, and in a sample it is denoted by $r$. \n\nValues of $r$ fall between $-1$ and $1$. How to interpret:\n\n+ Size: More extreme values (i.e., the The closer $r$ is to $+/- 1$) the stronger the linear association, and the closer to $0$ a weak/no association. Commonly used cut-offs are:\n    + Weak = $.1 < |r| < .3$\n    + Moderate = $.3 < |r| < .5$\n    + Strong = $|r| > .5$\n    \n+ Direction: The sign of $r$ says nothing about the strength of the association, but its nature and direction:\n    + Positive association means that values of one variable tend to be higher when values of the other variable are higher\n    + Negative association means that values of one variable tend to be lower when values of the other variable are higher\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation Matrix\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nA correlation matrix is a table showing the correlation coefficients - $r_{(x,y)}=\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(x,y)}{s_xs_y}$ - between variables. Each cell in the table shows the association between two variables. The diagonals show the correlation of a variable with itself (and are therefore always equal to 1).  \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nWe can create a correlation matrix by giving the `cor()` function a dataframe. It is important to remember that all variables **must** be numeric.\n:::\n\nLet's check the structure of the iris dataset to ensure that all variables are numeric:\n\n```{r}\nstr(iris)\n```\n\nWe can see that the variable *Species* in column 5 is a factor - this means that we cannot include this in our correlation matrix. Therefore, we need to *subset*, or, in other words, select specific columns. We can do this either giving the column numbers inside `[]`, or using `select()`. In our case, we want the variables in columns 1 - 4, just not 5.\n\nIf you had `NA` values within your dataset, you could choose to remove these `NA`s using `na.rm = TRUE` inside the `cor()` function.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Index dataframe (`[]`)\n\n```{r}\nround(cor(iris[,c(1:4)]), digits = 2)\n```\n\n## Variable selection (`select()`)\n\n```{r}\n# select only the columns we want by variable name, and pass this to cor()\niris %>% \n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) %>%\n  cor() %>%\n  round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Correlation - Hypothesis Testing\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe hypotheses of the correlation test are, as always, statements about the _population_ parameter (in this case the correlation between the two variables in the population - i.e., $\\rho$).  \n\nIf we are conducting a two tailed test, then... \n\n- $H_0: \\rho = 0$.

Note the key components of the `ggplot()` code:\n\n+ `data =` where we provide the name of the dataframe.\n+ `aes =` where we provide the aesthetics. These are things which we map from the data to the graph. For instance, the $x$-axis, or if we wanted to colour the columns/bars according to some aspect of the data.\n+ `+ geom_...` = where we add (using +) some geometry. These are the shapes (e.g., bars, points, etc.), which will be put in the correct place according to what we specified in `aes()`.\n+ `labs()` = where we provide labels for our plot (e.g., the $x$- and $y$-axis)\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\nThere are lots of arguments that you can further customise, some of which are specified in the examples below e.g., `bins = `, `alpha = `, `fill = `, `linewidth = `. `linetype = `, `size = ` etc. For these, you can look up the helper function to see the range of arguments they can take using `?` - e.g., `?fill`\n\nIf you'd like to read more about `ggplot()`, there is a handy [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).\n\n:::\n\nOne other thing to consider when visualising your data is how you are going to arrange your plots.

Outliers are extreme observations that are not possible values of a variable or that do not seem to fit with the rest of the data. This could either be:\n\n+ *marginally* along one axis: points that have an unusual (too high or too low) x-coordinate or y-coordinate;\n+ *jointly*: observations that do not fit with the rest of the point cloud \n\n**Basic:**\n\nWe need to specify `+ geom_point()` to get a scatterplot: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Fill points with color:**\n\nWithin `geom_point()`, we can specify `color = ` to fill the points with a color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"orange\") +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Change size and opacity:**\n\nWe can change the size (using `size =`) and the opacity (using `alpha =`) of our geom elements on the plot.

Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use `method = \"lm\"`. We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying `se = TRUE / FALSE`. \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n#### Boxplot\n\nWe can use a boxplot to visualise the association between one numeric variable and one categorical variable - these will be our y- and x-axis values respectively.\n\n**Basic:**\n\nWe need to specify `+ geom_boxplot()` to get a boxplot: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Change boxplot fill colours by group:**\n\nWithin `aes()`, we can specify `fill = ` to fill the boxes with a color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Change boxplot line colours by group:**\n\nWithin `aes()`, we can specify `color = ` to colour the lines with a color:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Adding jitter:**\n\nWe can add jittered points to a boxplot to better see the underlying distribution of the data (by adding a little random variation to each data point) via `geom_jitter()`: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    geom_jitter() + \n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Change legend position:**\n\nWe can add the argument `+ theme(legend.position = )` to move (or even remove) the legend by specifying, for example, ` \"right\" `, ` \"left\" `, ` \"top\" `, ` \"bottom\" `, or  `\"none\" ` to remove. \n\n```{r}\n# legend at bottom of plot\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\") + \n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n#### Facets\n\nWhen we have two numeric variables, as well as categorical variables, we can use `facet_wrap()` / `facet_grid()` to help divide/arrange our plots. If we had two categorical variables, by simply stringing them together to further group our plots by specifying `facet_wrap( ~ cat_variable1 + cat_variable2)`\n\n**Basic:**\n\nWe need to specify `+ geom_point()` to get a scatterplot, and *either* `+ facet_wrap()` or  `+ facet_grid()` to separate by your categorical variable: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Sepal.Length)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(~Species) + \n    labs(x = \"Petal Length (in cm)\", y = \"Sepal Length (in cm)\")\n```\n\n**Add a line of best fit:**\n\nWe can superimpose (i.e., add) a line of best fit by including the argument `+ geom_smooth()`. Since we want to fit a straight line, we want to use `method = \"lm\"`. We can also specify whether we want to display confidence intervals around our line by specifying `se = TRUE / FALSE`.

In this case, the perimeter is the dependent variable, and the side is the independent variable.\n\nThis is what we would refer to as a *deterministic model*, as it is a model of an *exact relationship* - there can be no deviation.\n\n**Model Specification**\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## In words\n\nThe perimeter of a square is four times the length of its side.\n\n\n## In symbols\n\nThe relationship between side and perimeter of squares is given by:\n\n$$\nPerimeter = 4 * Side\n$$\n\nIf you denote $y$ as the dependent variable _Perimeter_, and $x$ as the independent variable _Side_ we can rewrite as: \n\n$$\ny = 4 * x\n$$\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Deterministic Models - Visualisation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLet's create a dataset called `squares`, containing the perimeter of four squares having sides of length $0, 2, 5, 9$ meters, and then plot the `squares` data as points on a scatterplot. \n\nFirst, let's make our squares data. Here we will use two important functions - `tibble()` and `c()`. The `tibble()` function allows us to construct a data frame. To store a sequence of numbers into R, we can **c**ombine the values using `c()`. A sequence of elements all of the same type is called a *vector*.\n\n```{r}\n#create data frame named squares\nsquares <- tibble(\n  side = c(0, 2, 5, 9), \n  perimeter = 4 * side\n)\n\n#check that our values are contained within squares\nsquares\n```\n\nNow we know how `ggplot()` works, we can start to build our plot. First we specify our data (we want to use the *squares* data frame), and then our aesthetics. Since the perimeter varies as a function of side, we want side on the $x$-axis, and perimeter on the $y$-axis. We want to create a scatterplot, so we need to specify our `geom_...` argument as `geom_point()`. Lastly, we will provide clearer axis labels, and include the units of measurement. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-squares1\n\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +  \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n```\n\nWe could also visualise the functional relationship by connecting the individual points with a line. To do so, we need to add a new argument - `geom_line()`. If you would like to change the colour of the line from the default, you can specify `geom_line(colour = \"insert colour name\")`. \n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = squares, aes(x = side, y = perimeter)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(colour = \"blue\") + \n  labs(x = 'Side (m)', y = 'Perimeter (m)',  title = 'Perimeter = 4*Side')  \n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Deterministic Models - Predicted Values\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nSometimes we can directly read a predicted value from the graph of the functional relationship.\n\nConsider the plot created above.

In our case, we would say a side of 2.5m corresponds to a perimeter of 10m. \n\nHowever, in this case it is not that easy to read it from the drawing...

By specifying a null hypothesis (typically stating no effect or no association) and an alternative hypothesis (indicating the presence of an association), we create a structured approach for determining the statistical significance of model parameters. Without specifying hypotheses, the interpretation of results would lack focus, making it difficult to assess the validity and relevance of the model's findings.\n\nIn regression analysis, hypothesis testing for beta coefficients is used to assess whether (each) predictor variable significantly contributes to the model. \n\nThe way we specify hypotheses is similar across simple and multiple regression models.\n\nFor each regression coefficient $\\beta_j$ (for predictor $X_j$):\n\n+ Null hypothesis ($H_0$) = $\\beta_j = 0$: The predictor variable ($X_j$) is not associated with the DV  \n+ Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) = $\\beta_j \\neq 0$: The predictor variable ($X_j$) is associated with the DV  \n  \n  \nBased on the $p$-value or comparison of the $t$-statistic with the critical value, you can conclude whether the predictor variable is significant or not (see the simple & multiple regression Models - extracting information > model coefficients flashcard below):\n\n+ Reject $H_0$ if $|t_j|$ > critical value or $p$-value $< \\alpha$ \n+ Fail to reject $H_0$ if $|t_j|$ $\\leq$ critical value or $p$-value $\\geq \\alpha$ \n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Simple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe association between two variables (e.g., recall accuracy and age) will show deviations from the 'average pattern'.

We typically refer to the outcome (‘dependent’) variable with the letter $y$ and to our predictor (‘explanatory’/‘independent’) variables with the letter $x$.

That is, we could write it as multiplied by 1.\n\nIncluding the 1 explicitly is not necessary because it is included by default (you can check this by comparing the outputs of A & B above with and without the 1 included - the estimates are the same!). After a while, you will find you just want to drop the 1 when calling `lm()` because you know that it’s going to be there, but in these early weeks we tried to keep it explicit to make it clear that you want the intercept to be estimated. \n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Numeric Outcomes & Predictors\n\n`r optbegin(\"Simple Linear Regression Models - Example\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nImagine that you were tasked to investigate whether there was an association between recall accuracy and age.

For the purpose of this example, our dataset is called \"tips\" (you might recall this from DAPR1):\n\n```{r}\nstr(tips)\n```\n\nFrom the output, we can see that `Credit` (whether guests paid with a credit card; n/y responses) was coded as a `<chr>` or character variable. If we wanted to set this as a factor so that `R` recognises it as a categorical variable, we can use on of the following:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### `as_factor()`\n\n```{r}\ntips <- tips %>% \n  mutate(Credit = as_factor(Credit))\n```\n\n### `factor()`\n\nWe could also use the `factor()` function, and at the same time label factors appropriately to aid reader interpretation (it may not be immediately clear to some that *n* represents 'No' and *y* represents 'Yes'). To do so, we list the all levels of `Credit`, and provide a new label corresponding to each level:\n\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ntips$Credit <- factor(tips$Credit, \n                      levels = c(\"n\", \"y\"),\n                      labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"))\n```\n\n:::\n\nUsing either of the above approaches, if we now run `str(tips)` again, you should see that `Credit` is now coded as a factor with 2 levels:\n\n```{r}\nstr(tips)\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Binary Predictors\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nBinary variables have two categories (more commonly referred to as levels), and these levels (e.g., Yes/No, Dog/Cat, Right/Left, Smoker/Non-Smoker) are simply entered in the model as a series of 0s and 1s. Numeric variables that represent categorical data are typically referred to as __dummy variables__.  \n\nOur coefficients are just the same as before. The intercept is where our predictor equals zero, and the slope is the change in our outcome variable associated with a 1-unit change in our predictor.\n\nHowever, “zero” for this predictor variable now corresponds to a whole level. This is known as the “reference level”. Accordingly, the 1-unit change in our predictor (the move from “zero” to “one”) corresponds to the difference between the two levels. \n\nWhen used as predictors in multiple regression models, binary variables behave much the same way. The coefficient will give us the estimated change in $y$ when moving from one level to the other, whilst holding other predictors constant (for more info, see the **Multiple Linear Regression Models - Description & Specification** flashcard, specifically the section on interpretation of multiple regression coefficients).\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Categorical Predictors with k levels\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWhen we have a _categorical_ explanatory variable with __more than 2 levels__, our model gets a bit more complex - it needs not just one, but _a number of_ dummy variables. For a categorical variable with $k$ levels, we can express it in $k-1$ dummy variables.  \n\nFor example, the \"species\" column below has three levels, and can be expressed by the two variables \"species_dog\" and \"species_parrot\": \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=\"80%\"}\ndata.frame(\n  species = c(\"cat\",\"cat\",\"dog\",\"parrot\",\"dog\",\"cat\",\"...\"),\n  species_dog = c(0,0,1,0,1,0,\"...\"),\n  species_parrot = c(0,0,0,1,0,0,\"...\")\n)\n```\n\n+ The \"cat\" level is expressed whenever both the \"species_dog\" and \"species_parrot\" variables are 0.\n+ The \"dog\" level is expressed whenever the \"species_dog\" variable is 1 and the \"species_parrot\" variable is 0.\n+ The \"parrot\" level is expressed whenever the \"species_dog\" variable is 0 and the \"species_parrot\" variable is 1.  \n\n`R` will do all of this re-expression for us. If we include in our model a categorical explanatory variable with 3 different levels, the model will estimate 2 parameters - one for each dummy variable. We can interpret the parameter estimates (the coefficients we obtain using `coefficients()`,`coef()` or `summary()`) as the estimated increase in the outcome variable associated with an increase of one in each dummy variable (holding all other variables equal).  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(348)\ncatplot <- tibble(\n  species = rep(c(\"cat\",\"dog\",\"parrot\"), each = 15),\n  outcome = c(rnorm(15,60,5), rnorm(15,50,5), rnorm(15,55,5))\n)\ncstat = coef(lm(outcome~species,catplot))\npander::pander(summary(lm(outcome~species,catplot))$coefficients)\n```\n\nRecall that the intercept is the estimated outcome when all predictors are zero. In our example then, this represents the cat. We think of the \"cat\" category in this example as the _reference level_ - it is the category against which other categories are compared against. Therefore, in the above example, an increase in 1 of \"species_dog\" is the difference between a \"cat\" and a \"dog\". An increase in one of \"species_parrot\" is the difference between a \"cat\" and a \"parrot\". \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}\nggplot(catplot, aes(x=species, y=outcome))+\n  #geom_boxplot(fatten=NULL)+\n  geom_jitter(height=0,width=.05, alpha=.4)+\n  geom_point(x=1,y=cstat[1], col=\"blue\",size=3)+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=1,y=cstat[1],label=expression(paste(beta[0], \" (intercept)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=1.1)+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[2]),col=\"blue\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=2,xend=2,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[2]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=2.15,y=mean(c(cstat[1],sum(cstat[1:2]))),label=expression(paste(beta[1], \" (slope)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=.35)+\n  \n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[3]),col=\"blue\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=1,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  geom_segment(aes(x=3,xend=3,y=cstat[1],yend=cstat[1]+cstat[3]),col=\"blue\", lty=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"text\",x=3.15,y=mean(c(cstat[1],sum(cstat[c(1,3)]))),label=expression(paste(beta[2], \" (slope)\")), col=\"blue\", hjust=.35)\n```\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Dummy vs Effects Coding\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n\nPossible side-constraints on the parameters are:\n\n|       Name      |             Constraint            |             Meaning of $\\beta_0$            |         R         |\n|:---------------:|:---------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|\n| Sum to zero (Effects Coding) | $\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 = 0$ | $\\beta_0 = \\mu$   |    `contr.sum`    |\n| Reference group (Dummy Coding) |           $\\beta_1 = 0$           | $\\beta_0 = \\mu_1$ | `contr.treatment` |\n\n\n**Dummy Coding**\n\nBy default `R` uses the reference group constraint - i.e., dummy coding  (sometimes called treatment contrast coding). If your factor has $g$ levels, your regression model will have $g-1$ dummy variables (`R` creates them for you, as we've seen in the examples above). \n\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated $y$ when all predictors (i.e., $x$'s) are zero. Because the reference level is kind of like “0” in our contrast matrix, this is part of the intercept estimate. We get out a coefficient for each subsequent level, which are the estimated differences from each level to the reference group.\n\n\n**Effects Coding**\n\nEffects coding (sometimes called sum-to-zero coding) is the next most commonly used in psychological research. These are a way of comparing each level to the overall (or grand) mean. This involves a bit of trickery that uses -1s and 1s rather than 0s and 1s, in order to make “0” be mid-way between all the levels - the average of the levels.\n\nWhen we use this approach, the intercept is the estimated average $y$ when averaged across all levels of the predictor variable. In other words, it is the estimated grand mean of $y$. The coefficients represent the estimated difference for that level from the overall grand mean.\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**\n\nIf we want to use effects coding, we can apply:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.sum\"\n```\n\nWe can switch back to the default reference group constraint by applying either of these:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\n# Option 1\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- NULL\n\n# Option 2\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.treatment\"\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Categorical Predictors - Interpretation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLet's apply this to a different example - the iris dataset, and specifically, the Species categorical variable:\n\n```{r}\n#check what levels we have\nlevels(iris$Species)\n```\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Dummy Coding\n\nFrom the above, we can see that Species has 3 levels - \"setosa\", \"versicolor\", and \"virginica\". If we put these into a model, assuming `R`'s default ordering, we know that `R` will automatically apply dummy (or treatment coding), and \"setosa\" will be taken as our reference group:\n\n```{r}\n#fit model\nspec_model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model)\n```\n\nLet's first map our coefficients and estimates:\n\n| Coefficient | Estimate | Corresponds to |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| (Intercept)   |  5.0060 | $\\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu_1$\n| Speciesversicolor      | 0.9300  | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 = \\hat \\mu_2$ |\n| Speciesvirginica         | 1.5820  | $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 = \\hat \\mu_3$ |\n\n+ The estimate corresponding to (Intercept) contains $\\hat \\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu_1 = 5.01$. The estimated average sepal length for the species setosa was approximately 5.01.\n\n+ The second estimate corresponds to `Speciesversicolor` and was $\\hat \\beta_1 = 0.93$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` and `versicolor` species was estimated to be $0.93~cm$. Thus, $\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 0.93 = 5.94$. We could say - the species iris versicolor had a sepal length of approximately 5.94cm, and this was approximately 0.93cm longer than the iris setosa. This difference was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n+ The third estimate corresponds to `Speciesvirginica` and was $\\hat \\beta_2 = 1.58$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` and `virginica` species was estimated to be $1.58~cm$. Thus, $\\hat \\mu_2 = 5.01 + 1.58 = 6.59$. We could say - the species iris virginica had a sepal length of approximately 6.59cm, and this was approximately 1.58cm longer than the iris setosa. This difference was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n### Effects Coding\n\nFirst we need to tell `R` to apply effects (or sum-to-zero) coding and check the ordering of the levels:\n\n```{r}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.sum\"\ncontrasts(iris$Species) \n```\n\nThen we can run our model:\n\n```{r}\n#fit model\nspec_model2 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)\nsummary(spec_model2)\n```\n\n```{r echo = FALSE}\ncontrasts(iris$Species) <- \"contr.treatment\"\ncontrasts(iris$Species) \n```\n\nLet's first map our coefficients and estimates:\n\n| Coefficient | Estimate | Corresponds to |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| (Intercept)   |  5.84333  | $\\beta_0 = \\frac{\\mu_1 + \\mu_2 + \\mu_3}{3} = \\mu$\n| Species1      | -0.83733  | $\\beta_1 = \\mu_1 - \\mu$|\n| Species2      | 0.09267   | $\\beta_2 = \\mu_2 - \\mu$ |\n\n+ The first estimate corresponding to (Intercept) contains $\\hat \\beta_0 = \\hat \\mu = 5.84$. The estimated average sepal length across iris species was approximately $5.84~cm$.\n\n+ The second estimate corresponds to `Species1` and was $\\hat \\beta_1 = -0.84$. The difference in mean sepal length between `setosa` $(\\hat \\mu_1)$ and the grand mean $(\\hat \\mu_0)$  was estimated to be $0.84~cm$. In other words, the iris species of setosa had a sepal length $0.84~cm$ shorter than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 + (-0.83733) = 5~cm$. This difference in length was statistically significant $(p < .001)$.\n\n+ The third estimate corresponds to `Species2` and was $\\hat \\beta_2 = 0.09$. The difference in mean sepal length between `versicolor` $(\\hat \\mu_2)$ and the grand mean $(\\hat \\mu_0)$  was estimated to be $0.09~cm$. In other words, the iris species of versicolor had a sepal length $0.09~cm$ longer than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 + 0.09267 = 5.94~cm$. This difference in length was not statistically significant $(p = .121)$.\n\n+ The estimate for `Species3`, representing the difference of “virginica” to the grand mean is *not shown* by `summary()`. Because of the side-constraint, we know that $\\mu_3 = \\beta_0 - (\\beta_1 + \\beta_2)$. The difference in sepal length between `virginica` and the grand mean was estimated to be $-(-0.83733 + 0.09267) = 0.74466$. In other words, the virginica iris species had a sepal length $0.74~cm$ longer than average, where its length was estimated to be $5.84333 - (-0.83733  + 0.09267) = 6.59~cm$.  \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br>   \n\n`r optbegin(\"Specifying Reference Levels\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWhen you have a categorical variable coded as a factor, `R` will default to using alphabetical ordering - hence in our example above \"cat\" was the reference level (as opposed to \"dog\" or \"parrot\"), and in the other \"setosa\" was the reference level (as opposed to \"versicolor\" or \"virginica\").\n\nWe could override this by making it a factor with an ordering to it’s levels (see the use of `factor()` and `levels()`).

The larger our $t$-statistic, the more confident we can be that the coefficient is not 0. \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nIf you wanted to obtain just the $t$-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `coef(summary(mdl))[, \"t value\"]`\n- `summary(mdl)$coefficients[,3]` \n\n:::\n\n### Pr(>|t|)\n\nFrom our $t$-value, we can compute our $p$-value.

The $p$-value of each estimate indicates the probability of observing a $t$-value at least as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from the sample data when assuming the null hypothesis to be true.\n\nIn Psychology, a $p$-value < .05 is usually used to make statements regarding statistical significance (it is important that you always state your $\\alpha$ level to help your reader understand any statements regarding statistical significance).\n\nThe number of asterisks marks corresponds with the significance of the coefficient (see the 'Signif. codes' legend just under the coefficients section). \n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nIf you wanted to obtain just the $p$-values for each estimated regression coefficient, you could do the following (for this below example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `summary(mdl)$coefficients[,4]` \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## $\\sigma$\n\n```{r mlroutputresideror, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Multiple regression output in R, model standard deviation of the errors highlighted\", fig.align = 'left'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/recall_mdl_residerror.PNG\")\n```\n\nThe standard deviation of the errors, denoted by $\\sigma$, is an important quantity that our model estimates. It represents how much individual data points tend to deviate above and below the regression line - in other words, it tells us how well the model fits the data. \n\nA small $\\sigma$ indicates that the points hug the line closely and we should expect fairly accurate predictions, while a large $\\sigma$ suggests that, even if we estimate the line perfectly, we can expect individual values to deviate from it by substantial amounts.\n\nThe *estimated* standard deviation of the errors is denoted $\\hat \\sigma$, and is estimated by essentially averaging squared residuals (giving the variance) and taking the square-root: \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\hat \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{SS_{Residual}}{n - k - 1}} \\\\\n\\qquad \\\\\n& \\text{where} \\\\\n& SS_{Residual} = \\textrm{Sum of Squared Residuals} = \\sum_{i=1}^n{(\\epsilon_i)^2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n:::blue\n**In R**\n\nThere are a couple of equivalent ways to obtain the estimated standard deviation of the errors --- that is, $\\hat \\sigma$ --- from the fitted model (for this example, our fitted model has been named `mdl`):\n\n- `sigma(mdl)`\n- `summary(mdl)`\n\n::: \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Manual Contrasts\n\nDummy and effects coding allow us to  test the significance of the difference between means of groups and some other mean (either reference group or grand mean respectively).

First, think back to [\"Type 1 errors\" from DAPR1](https://uoepsy.github.io/dapr1/2324/lectures/dapr1_2_05_errorspower.pdf) - when we conduct an hypothesis test, and we set $\\alpha = .05$, we will reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ when we find a $p < .05$. Now remember what a $p$-value represents - it is the chance of observing a statistic at least as extreme as the one we do have, assuming the null hypothesis to be true. This means that *if* $H_0$ **is** true, then we will still observe a $p < .05$ 5\\% of the time. So our chance of making this error = the threshold ($\\alpha$) at which below a $p$-value results in us rejecting $H_0$. \n\nBut this error-rate applies to each statistical hypothesis we test. So if we conduct an experiment in which we plan on conducting lots of tests of different comparisons, the chance of an error being made increases substantially. Across the family of tests performed that chance will be much higher than 5\\%.^[what defines a 'family' of tests is debatable.]\n\nEach test conducted at $\\alpha = .05$ has a .05 (or 5%) probability of Type I error (wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis). If we do 9 tests, that experiment-wise error rate is $\\alpha_{ew} \\leq 9 \\times .05$, where 9 is the number of comparisons made as part of the experiment.\n\nThus, if nine **independent** comparisons were made at the $\\alpha = .05$ level, the experiment-wise Type I error rate $\\alpha_{ew}$ would be at most $9 \\times .05 = 0.45$. That is, we could wrongly reject the null hypothesis on average 45 times out of 100.  \n  \nTo make this more confusing, many of the tests in a family are not **independent** (see the lecture slides for the calculation of error rate for dependent tests).  \n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br>  \n\n`r optbegin(\"When to use Which Correction\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Bonferroni**  \n\n- Use Bonferroni’s method when you are interested in a small number of planned contrasts (or pairwise comparisons).\n- Bonferroni's method is to divide alpha by the number of tests/confidence intervals.\n- Assumes that all comparisons are independent of one another.  \n- It sacrifices slightly more power than Tukey’s method (discussed below), but it can be applied to any set of contrasts or linear combinations (i.e., it is useful in more situations than Tukey).\n- It is usually better than Tukey if we want to do a small number of planned comparisons.  \n\n**Šídák**  \n\n- (A bit) more powerful than the Bonferroni method.\n- Assumes that all comparisons are independent of one another. \n- Less common than Bonferroni method, largely because it is more difficult to calculate (not a problem now we have computers).  \n\n**Tukey**\n\n- It specifies an exact family significance level for comparing all pairs of treatment means.  \n- Use Tukey’s method when you are interested in all (or most) pairwise comparisons of means.  \n\n**Scheffe**\n\n- It is the most conservative (least powerful) of all tests.\n- It controls the family alpha level for testing all possible contrasts.\n- It should be used if you have not planned contrasts in advance.\n- For testing pairs of treatment means it is too conservative (you should use Bonferroni or Šídák).\n\n**Others**  \n  \n- In the wider literature, Holm's step-down and Hochberg's step-up mentioned.

The alternative hypothesis is that **at least one of the slopes is not zero**. \n\n\nThe $F$-ratio you see at the bottom of `summary(model)` is actually a comparison between two models: your model (with some explanatory variables in predicting $y$) and the *null model*. \n\nIn regression, the null model can be thought of as the model in which all explanatory variables have zero regression coefficients. It is also referred to as the __intercept-only model__, because if all predictor variable coefficients are zero, then we are only estimating $y$ via an intercept (which will be the mean - $\\bar y$). \n\n**Interpretation:** \n\nAlongside viewing the $F$-ratio, you can see the results from testing the null hypothesis that all of the coefficients are $0$ (the alternative hypothesis is that at least one coefficient is $\\neq 0$. Under the null hypothesis that all coefficients = 0, the ratio of explained:unexplained variance should be approximately 1)\n\nIf your model predictors do explain some variance, the $F$-ratio will be significant, and you would reject the null, as this would suggest that your predictor variables included in your model improved the model fit (in comparison to the intercept only model).\n\n\n*Points to note:*\n\n- The larger your $F$-ratio, the better your model\n- The $F$-ratio will be close to 1 when the null is true (i.e., that all slopes are zero)\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**\n\nWe can see the $F$-statistic and associated $p$-value at the bottom of the output of `summary(<modelname>)`:\n\n```{r mlroutputf, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Multiple regression output in R, F statistic highlighted\", fig.align = 'left'}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/recall_mdl_output_f.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\n**Example Interpretation**\n\nThe linear model with recall confidence and age explained a significant amount of variance in recall accuracy beyond what we would expect by chance $F(2, 17) = 12.92, p < .001$. \n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"R-squared and Adjusted R-squared\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n**Overview:**\n\n$R^2$ represents the proportion of variance in $Y$ that is explained by the model predictor variables. \n\n**Formula:**\n\nThe $R^2$ coefficient is defined as the proportion of the total variability in the outcome variable which is explained by our model:\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{SS_{Model}}{SS_{Total}} = 1 - \\frac{SS_{Residual}}{SS_{Total}}\n$$\n\nThe Adjusted $R^2$ coefficient is defined as:\n$$\n\\hat R^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}\n\\quad \\\\\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& n = \\text{sample size} \\\\\n& k = \\text{number of explanatory variables} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n<br>\n\n**When to report Multiple $R^2$ vs. Adjusted $R^2$:**\n\nThe Multiple $R^2$ value should be reported for a simple linear regression model (i.e., one predictor).   \n\nUnlike $R^2$, Adjusted-$R^2$ does not necessarily increase with the addition of more explanatory variables, by the inclusion of a penalty according to the number of explanatory variables in the model.

This would allow us to check if the errors have a mean of zero. If this assumption was met, the residuals would appear to be randomly scattered around zero.  \n  \nThe rationale for this is that, once you remove from the data the linear trend, what's left over in the residuals should not have any trend, i.e. have a mean of zero.\n\n### Multiple Regression\nIn multiple regression, however, it becomes more necessary to rely on diagnostic plots of the model residuals. This is because we need to know whether the relations are linear between the outcome and each predictor _after accounting for the other predictors in the model._   \n\nIn order to assess this, we use **partial-residual plots** (also known as 'component-residual plots'). This is a plot with each explanatory variable $x_j$ on the x-axis, and **partial residuals** on the y-axis***.\n\nPartial residuals for a predictor $x_j$ are calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat \\epsilon + \\hat \\beta_j x_j\n$$\n\n:::blue\n\nIn **R**:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Simple Linear Regression\n\n```{r}\n#specify model\nrecall_simp <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plot\nggplot(recalldata, aes(x = age, y = recall_accuracy)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, colour = \"blue\") + #fit straight line to data\n    geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE, colour = \"red\") + #fit loess line to data\n    labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Recall Accuracy\")\n\n```\n\n:::frame\n\n[**Interpretation Guidance**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\nThe loess line should closely follow the data.\n\n:::\n\n### Multiple Linear Regression\n\nWe can create these plots for all predictors in the model by using the `crPlots()` function from the **car** package:\n\n```{r}\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#create plots\ncrPlots(recall_mdl)\n```\n\n\n:::frame\n\n[**Interpretation Guidance**]{style=\"color:red;\"}\n\nYou are looking for the pink line to follow a linear trend line (i.e., follow the blue line).

It is important to be familiar with your dataset, as you need to know what values are typical, normal, and possible. Could it be the case that you have missed some impossible values (e.g., a negative value of a persons height), values outwith the possible range (e.g., a score of 55 on a survey where scores can only range 10-50), values that don't make any sense (e.g., an age of 200), or maybe there are even typos / data entry errors (e.g., forgetting to put a decimal point, so having a height of 152m instead of 1.52m)! \n\nIf there is a simple error in the data, it could be that you can fix the typo. If that is not possible (maybe you didn't collect the data, so are unsure of what the value(s) should/could be), you will need to delete the value (i.e., set as an `NA`), because you know that it is incorrect. \n\nWe should aim to never change a legitimate value where possible (and remember that if you have a large dataset, a small number of extreme values will be unlikely to have a strong influence on your results). \n\nIf there is an extreme, but legitimate value that you have determined is adversely influencing your model (i.e., by examining the assumptions and diagnostics as outlined above), you may want to consider ways to reduce this influence (e.g., **winsorizing** -  which essentially truncates or caps the identified extreme values to a specified percentile, in turn reducing their influence on the model without completely eliminating the observation(s). For example, you could replace values below the 5th percentile with the 5th percentile value, and values above the 95th percentile with the 95th percentile value).\n\nIf after re-examining your data you cannot identify any atypical, non-normal, or impossible values, you may need to select a different approach as outlined below. \n\n## Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThis allows us to assess the **sensitivity** of our results (i.e., parameter estimates, p-values, confidence intervals) to changes in our modelling approach (i.e., the removal of observations).\n\nWe can re-fit our model after excluding our identified outliers and potentially influential observations, and compare these results to the original model.\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false collapse=true}\n\n# Process of Removing Observations\n\nThe current example involves removing all identified outliers and potentially influential observations at the same time. Ideally, and to ensure a more thorough sensitivity analysis, you would remove each of these observations one at a time, assess the effects on the model by comparing to your original, reassessing the remaining pre-identified observations, and repeating the process if necessary. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Original Model\n\n```{r}\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata) \nsummary(wb_mdl1)\n```\n\n\n### Model with Observations Removed\n\n```{r}\n## wellbeing model\nwb_mdl2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + social_int, data = mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ])\nsummary(wb_mdl2)\n```\n\n\n### Compare `summary()` output\n\n```{r}\ntab_model(wb_mdl1, wb_mdl2,\n          dv.labels = c(\"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\", \"Wellbeing (WEMWBS Scores)\"),\n          pred.labels = c(\"outdoor_time\" = \"Outdoor Time (hours per week)\",\n                          \"social_int\" = \"Social Interactions (number per week)\"),\n          title = \"Regression Table for Wellbeing Models wb1 and wb2\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important icon=false appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nWe conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how robust our conclusions were regarding outdoor time and the weekly number of social interactions in the presence of previously identified outliers and potentially influential observations. We re-fit the model, excluding these 28 observations (14% of our original sample), and compared these model results (`wb_mdl2`) to those of our original model (`wb_mdl1`). \n\nThere was little difference in the estimates from `wb_mdl1` and `wb_mdl2`, and so we can conclude that after conducting a sensitivity analysis, there were no meaningful differences in our results, and hence our conclusions from our original model hold. Specifically:\n\n+ The direction of all model estimates are the same in `wb_mdl1` and `wb_mdl2` (i.e., all positive)\n+ There is no difference in statistical significance, and the p-values were of a similar magnitude (i.e., all < .001)\n+ The estimate and confidence intervals for `outdoor_time` are very similar\n+ There are some quantitative differences in the estimate and confidence intervals for `social_int`. The estimate differs slightly in magnitude by 0.07), but given that this remains positive and significant, we do not need to be too concerned about this. \n\n:::\n\n## Bootstrapping\n\nThe bootstrap method is an alternative non-parametric method of constructing a standard error. Instead of having to rely on calculating the standard error with a formula and potentially applying fancy mathematical corrections, bootstrapping involves mimicking the idea of “repeatedly sampling from the population”. It does so by repeatedly **re**sampling with **replacement** from our original sample.\n\nWhat this means is that we don’t have to rely on any assumptions about our model residuals, because we actually generate an actual distribution that we can take as an approximation of our sampling distribution, meaning that we can actually look at where 95% of the distribution falls, without having to rely on any summing of squared deviations.\n\nNote, the bootstrap may provide us with an alternative way of conducting inference, but our model may still be mis-specified. It is also very important to remember that bootstrapping is entirely reliant on utilising our original sample to pretend that it is a population (and mimic sampling from that population). If our original sample is not representative of the population that we’re interested in, bootstrapping doesn’t help us at all.\n\n## OLS vs WLS Regression\n\nThe method of ordinary least squares regression (OLS: i.e., the type of regression model you have been fitting on the course) assumes that there is constant variance in the errors (*homoscedasticity*). The method of weighted least squares (WLS) can be used when the ordinary least squares assumption of constant variance in the errors is violated (i.e., you have evidence of *heteroscedasticity*, like we do in Q3 of this lab).\n\nIf we have some specific belief that your non-constant variance is due to differences in the variances of the outcome between various groups, then it might be better to use Weighted Least Squares.   \n\nAs an example, imagine we are looking at weight of different dog breeds (@fig-dogweight). The weights of chihuahuas are all quite close together (between 2 to 5kg), but the weight of, for example, spaniels is anywhere from 8 to 25kg - a much bigger variance. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-dogweight\n#| fig-cap: \"The weights of 49 dogs, of 7 breeds\"\nset.seed(4)\ndf <- tibble(\n  breed = c(\"chihuahua\",\"boxer\",\"pug\",\"spaniel\",\"golden retriever\",\"beagle\",\"lurcher\"),\n  m = c(8,70,18,24,70,30,45),\n  sd = c(2,10,6,24,15,8,5)\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    weight = map2(m,sd, ~rnorm(7,.x,.y)*0.454)\n  ) |> select(breed,weight) |> unnest(cols = c(weight))\ndf$breed = factor(df$breed, levels=c(\"beagle\",\"pug\",\"spaniel\",\"chihuahua\",\"boxer\",\"golden retriever\",\"lurcher\"))\ndogdf<-df\n#save(dogdf, file=\"../../uoepsy/data/dogweight.RData\")\n\n\ndf_ms = df |> group_by(breed) |> summarise(m = round(mean(weight),1))\nggplot(df, aes(x=breed,y=weight))+\n  geom_boxplot(fatten = NULL) + \n  stat_summary(geom=\"segment\", \n               mapping=aes(xend=..x..-.375,yend=..y..,col=breed)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"segment\", \n               mapping=aes(xend=..x..+.375,yend=..y..,col=breed)) + \n  geom_label(data=df_ms,aes(label=m,y=m,col=breed))+\n  guides(col=\"none\") +\n  labs(x=\"Dog Breed\",y=\"Weight (kg)\")\n\n```\n\nRecall that the default way that `lm()` deals with categorical predictors such as `dog breed`, is to compare each one to a reference level. In this case, that reference level is \"beagle\" (first in the alphabet). Looking at @fig-dogweight above, which comparison do you feel more confident in? \n\n- **A:** Beagles (14kg) vs Pugs (9.1kg). A difference of 4.9kg.  \n- **B:** Beagles (14kg) vs Spaniels (19kg). A difference of 5kg.  \n\nHopefully, your intuition is that **A** looks like a clearer difference than **B** because there's less overlap between Beagles and Pugs than between Beagles and Spaniels. Our standard linear model, however, assumes the standard errors are identical for each comparison:  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ndogmodel <- lm(weight~breed, dogdf)\n.pp(summary(dogmodel),l = list(3,9:18))\n```\n\nFurthermore, we can see that we have heteroscedasticity in our residuals - the variance is not constant across the model:  \n```{r}\n#| fig-height: 3\nplot(dogmodel, which=3)\n```\n\nWeighted least squares is a method that allows us to apply weights to each observation, where the size of the weight indicates the precision of the information contained in that observation.  \n\nWe can, in our dog-breeds example, allocate different weights to each breed. Accordingly, the Chihuahuas are given higher weights (and so Chihuahua comparisons result in a smaller SE), and Spaniels and Retrievers are given lower weights. \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(nlme)\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/dogweight.RData\"))\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, \n                 weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\nsummary(dogmod_wls)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nlibrary(nlme)\ndogmod_wls = gls(weight ~ breed, data = dogdf, weights = varIdent(form = ~ 1 | breed))\n.pp(summary(dogmod_wls),l = list(16:25))\n```\n\nWe _can_ also apply weights that change according to continuous predictors (e.g. observations with a smaller value of $x$ are given more weight than observations with larger values). \n\n## Data Transformations\n\nA data transformation involves the replacement of a variable (e.g., $y$) by a function of that variable in order to change the shape of a distribution or association (e.g., to help reduce skew). We can transform the outcome variable prior to fitting the model, using something such as `log(y)` or `sqrt(y)`. This will sometimes allow us to estimate a model for which our assumptions are satisfied.\n\nSome of the most common (not an exhaustive list) transformations are:\n\n+ **Log (`log(y)`)**: Often used for reducing right skewness. Note, this transformation cannot be applied to zero or negative values (make sure to check your data!)\n+ **Square root (`sqrt(y)`)**: Also often used for reducing right skewness. This transformation can be applied to zero values (but not negative), and is commonly applied to count data\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-trouble1\n#| fig-cap: \"A model of a transformed outcome variable can sometimes avoid violations of assumptions that arise when modeling the outcome variable directly. Data from https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\"\n\n# set.seed(4)\n# df <- tibble(\n#   x = runif(100,1,100),\n#   ly = x*.01 + rnorm(100),\n#   y = exp(ly)\n# )\n# write_csv(df %>% select(x,y), file=\"../../uoepsy/data/trouble1.csv\")\ndf <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/trouble1.csv\") |> mutate(ly=log(y))\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nhist(df$y, breaks=30, main=\"marginal distribution of y\",xlab=\"y\")\nwith(df,plot(y~x, main=\"lm(y ~ x)\\nassumptions violated\",xlab=\"x\",ylab=\"y\"))\nabline(lm(y~x,df),col=\"red\")\nhist(df$ly,  breaks=30, main=\"marginal distribution of log(y)\",xlab=\"log(y)\")\nwith(df,plot(ly~x, main=\"lm(log(y) ~ x)\\nassumptions satisfied\",xlab=\"x\",ylab=\"log(y)\"))\nabline(lm(ly~x,df),col=\"red\")\n```\n\nThe major downside of this is that we are no longer modelling $y$, but some transformation $f(y)$ ($y$ with some function $f$ applied to it). Interpretation of the coefficients changes accordingly, such that we are no longer talking in terms of changes in y, but changes in $f(y)$. When the transformation function used is non-linear (see the Right-Hand of @fig-logtr) a change in $f(y)$ is **not the same** for every $y$. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-logtr\n#| fig-cap: \"The log transformation is non-linear\"\n#| fig-height: 3.5\n#| echo: false\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\nwith(df,plot(y,2*y,main=\"y and 2*(y)\",xlab=\"y\",ylab=\"2(y)\"))\nwith(df,plot(y,ly,main=\"y and log(y)\",xlab=\"y\",ylab=\"log(y)\"))\n```\n\nFor certain transformations, we _can_ re-express coefficients to be interpretable with respect to $y$ itself. For instance, the model using a log transform $ln(y) = b_0 + b_1(x)$ gives us a coefficient that represents statement __A__ below. We can re-express this by taking the opposite function to logarithm, the exponent, `exp()`. Similar to how this works in logistic regression, the exponentiated coefficients obtained from `exp(coef(model))` are _multiplicative_, meaning we can say something such as statement __B__\n\n:::int\n\n- __A:__ \"a 1 unit change in $x$ is associated with a $b$ unit change in $ln(y)$\".  \n- __B:__ \"a 1 unit change in $x$ is associated with $e^b$ __percent__ change in $y$.\"\n\n:::\n\nFinding the optimal transformation to use can be difficult, but there are methods out there to help you. One such method is the BoxCox transformation, which can be conducted using `BoxCox(variable, lambda=\"auto\")`, from the __forecast__ package.^[This method finds an appropriate value for $\\lambda$ such that the transformation $(sign(x) |x|^{\\lambda}-1)/\\lambda$ results in a close to normal distribution.] \n\n## Using Non-Linear Models\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n### Generalized Linear Models\n\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) can appropriately deal with data that do not follow a normal distribution (which is a requirement for traditional linear models). They can accommodate various types of distributions, including the Poisson, binomial, and gamma distributions. This makes them suitable for modelling count data (e.g., number of sunny days Edinburgh has per year - yes, count data can include 0!), binary data (where there are only two possible values e.g., doesn't wear glasses vs wear glasses, smoker vs non-smoker, i.e., values that are yes/no or 0/1), and other types of non-normal data.\n\nWe will explore some GLMs later in the course (Semester 2 Block 4), where we will work with logistic regression models. \n\n### Higher Order Terms\n\nHigher order regression terms refer to the inclusion of polynomial terms of degree higher than one in a regression model. In a linear regression model, the association between the dependent variable ($Y$) and the independent variable ($X$) is assumed to be linear, which means the association can be represented by a straight line. However, in many real-world scenarios, associations between variables are not strictly linear, and including higher order regression terms can help capture more complex relationships. Higher order terms that you could incorporate include quadratic, cubic, or higher degree polynomial terms. \n\nFor example, in a quadratic regression model, the relationship between $Y$ and $X$ can be represented as:\n\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot X + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^2 + \\epsilon\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& Y = \\text{Dependent Variable} \\\\\n& X = \\text{Independent Variable} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAs in our models we've seen so far, $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, and $\\beta_2$ are the coefficients to be estimated in the above model. What is different from what we've seen in DAPR2 is the term $\\beta_2 \\cdot X^2$, and this represents the *quadratic term*. This allows for a curved as opposed to straight line to represent the association between $Y$ and $X$, and hence can allow us to capture more complex relationships. For example, we can model the association between height and age:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-nonlin\n#| fig-cap: \"Two linear models, one with a quadratic term (right)\"  \n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nset.seed(13)\ndf <- tibble(\n  age = sample(0:16,100,replace=T),\n  height = 70 + (7*age) - (17*scale(age)^2) + rnorm(100,0,10)\n)\nmod1 <- lm(height ~ age, data = df)\nmod2 <- lm(height ~ age + I(age^2), data = df)\ndf <- df %>% mutate(f1 = fitted(mod1),f2=fitted(mod2))\n\np1 <- ggplot(df,aes(x=age,y=height)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y=f1),lwd=1, col=\"blue\")  +\n  labs(title=\"Simple Linear Model\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 12)\n\np2 <- ggplot(df,aes(x=age,y=height)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y=f2),lwd=1,col=\"blue\") +\n  labs(title=\"Quadratic Model\") +    \n  theme_bw(base_size = 12)\n\np1 | p2\n```\n\nPlease note that these types of models are beyond the scope of the DAPR2 course, but if you want to know more, please do read up on these in your own time. \n:::\n\n## Removing Observations\n\nRemoving outliers and potentially influential observations should be a last resort - not all outliers are inherently 'bad' - we do expect natural variation in our population(s) of interest. Outliers can be informative about the topic under investigation, and this is why you need to be very careful about excluding outliers due only to their 'extremeness'. In doing so, you can distort your results by removing variability - i.e., by forcing the data to be more normal and less variable than it actually is, and reduce statistical power by reducing the size of your sample. \n\nIf you do decide to remove observations, you will need to document what specific data points you excluded, and provide an explanation as to why these were excluded. \n\nTo set specific values to `NA` in our dataset (and save this updated dataset in a new object named `mwdata2`), we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to set any `age` values of <20 as `NA`. In the original dataset `mwdata`, we had 3 individuals aged 18, and 6 aged 19, so we should end up with 9 `NA` values in `mwdata2` column `age`:\n\n```{r}\n#specify age column in original dataset, where age is < 20, for values to be set to NA and save to new object named mwdata2 to avoid overwriting original data\nmwdata2 <-  mwdata %>% \n    mutate(age = replace(age, age < 20, NA))\n\n#check how many NA values we have - there should be 9 (so 9 TRUEs):\ntable(is.na(mwdata2$age))\n```\n\nIf we wanted to remove a full row from the datset, we could use the following code. For the purpose of this demonstration, lets say that we wanted to remove all rows that were highlighted in the above assumption and diagnostic checks as potentially having an adverse influence on our model estimates:\n\n```{r}\n# create new dataset 'mwdata3' without (by specifying -) identified outliers and potentially influential observations\nmwdata3 <- mwdata[-c(16, 25, 50, 53, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 72, 73, 75, 76, 78, 79, 85, 101, 109, 125, 126, 127, 131, 149, 151, 159, 163, 165, 169, 173, 176, 179, 197), ]\n\n# check dimensions - should now have 32 rows less than original dataset 200 - 32 = 168\ndim(mwdata3)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Bootstrap\n\nThe _bootstrap_ is a general approach to assessing whether the sample results are statistically significant or not, and allows us to draw inferences to the population from a regression model. This method is assumption-free and does not rely on conditions such as normality of the residuals.\n\nIt is based on sampling repeatedly with replacement (to avoid always getting the original sample exactly) from the data at hand, and then computing the regression coefficients from each re-sample. We will equivalently use the word \"bootstrap sample\" or \"resample\" (for **sample** with **re**placement).\n\n`r optbegin(\"Overview\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThe basic principle is:\n\n<center>\n__The population is to the original sample__\n\n__as__\n\n__the original sample is to the bootstrap samples.__\n\n</center>\n\n\nBecause we only have one sample of size $n$, and we do not have access to the data for the entire population, we consider our original sample as our best approximation to the population. \n\nTo be more precise, we assume that the population is made up of many, many copies of our original sample. Then, we take multiple samples each of size $n$ from this assumed population. This is equivalent to sampling _with replacement_ from the original sample.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}\nknitr::include_graphics('images/reg-boot.png')\n```\n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Terminology\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n- A _parameter_ is a numerical summary for the population, e.g. the population slope $\\beta_1$.\n- A _statistic_ is a numerical summary calculated from the sample data, e.g. the estimated slope in the sample $\\widehat \\beta_1$. We use the sample statistic as a best guess, or estimate, for the unknown population parameter.\n- A _bootstrap sample_ is chosen with replacement from an existing sample, using the same sample size.\n- A _bootstrap statistic_ is a statistic computed for each bootstrap sample.\n- A _bootstrap distribution_ collects bootstrap statistics for many bootstrap samples.\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"In R\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n* 1: Load the **car** package.    \n  \n* 2: Use the `Boot()` function (do not forget the uppercase B!) which takes as arguments:\n    - the fitted model\n    - `f`, saying which bootstrap statistics to compute on each bootstrap sample. By default `f = coef`, returning the regression coefficients.\n    - `R`, saying how many bootstrap samples to compute. By default `R = 999` but this could be any number. To experiment we recommend 1000, when you want to produce results for journals, it is typical to go with 10,000 or more.\n    - `ncores`, saying if to perform the calculations in parallel (and more efficiently). However, this will depend on your PC, and you need to find how many cores you have by running `parallel::detectCores()` on your PC. By default the function uses `ncores = 1`.  \n     \n* 3: Run the code. However, please remember that the `Boot()` function does **not** want a model which was fitted using data with `NAs`. To remove, for example, you could use `na.omit`.  \n  \n* 4: Look at the `summary()` of the bootstrap results. When doing so the output will show, for each regression coefficient, the value in the original sample in the column `original`, and in the `bootSE` column, the estimate of the variability of the coefficient from bootstrap sample to bootstrap sample. The `bootSE` provides us the bootstrap standard error, or bootstrap SE in short. We can use this to answer the key question of how accurate our estimate is. \n  \n* 5: Compute confidence intervals via the `Confint()` function. Use your preferred confidence level (usually, and by default, 95%) by specifying `level = `. If you select 95% confidence intervals, by also specifying the `type = \"perc\"` argument, `R` will return the values that comprise 95% of all values in between them, i.e. the value with 2.5% of observations below it and the value with 2.5% of observations above it and 97.5% of observations below it.  \n  \n* 6: Provide interpretation in the context of your research question and report results in APA format. *(Note: the actual estimates are those from our original model, it is just the bounds of the interval that bootstrapping is providing us with)*. \n\n:::blue\n\n**In R**\n\n```{r}\n\n#specify model\nrecall_mdl <- lm(recall_accuracy ~ recall_confidence + age, data = recalldata)\n\n#step 1: load car package\nlibrary(car)\n\n#step 2/3: bootstrap model (asking to resample 1000 times, i.e., getting a distribution of 1000 values for the coefficients)\nbootmymodel <- Boot(recall_mdl, R = 1000)\n\n#step 4: check summary\nsummary(bootmymodel)\n\n#step 5: confidence intervals\nConfint(bootmymodel, level = 0.95, type = \"perc\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r optend()`\n\n<br> \n\n`r optbegin(\"Visualisation\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nYou can visualise the uncertainty in the estimates by plotting histograms using the built-in function from the **car** package, which simply takes the bootstrap results `bootmymodel`.

APA formatting applies to all aspects of writing - from formatting of papers (including tables and figures), citation of sources, and reference lists. This means that it also applies to how you present results in your Psychology courses, including DAPR2.\n\n`r optbegin(\"APA Formatting Guides\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nAll results should be presented following [APA guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/instructional-aids/numbers-statistics-guide.pdf). \n\nYou also need to follow APA style rules for [tables and figures](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/tables-figures). \n\nMake sure to familiarise yourself with the above guides, and practice presenting your results following these rules.\n\n`r optend()`\n\n## Tables\n\nWe want to ensure that we are presenting results in a well formatted table. To do so, there are lots of different packages available (see [Lesson 4 of the RMD bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/04-prettytab.html)). \n\nOne of the most convenient ways to present results from regression models is to use the `tab_model()` function from **sjPlot**\n\n`r optbegin(\"Creating tables via tab_model\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWithin `tab_model()`, there are lots of different ways that you can customise your table. The most common arguments that you should use are `dv.labels`, `pred.labels`, and `title`. \n\nYou can rename your DV and IV labels by specifying `dv.labels` and `pred.labels`. To do so, specify your variable name on the left, and what you would like this to be named in the table on the right. For `title`, you can simply specify in \"\"'s what you want your title to be e.g., `title = \"This is my title\"`. \n\nHere's an example if I had fitted a model with the following information:\n\n- Model name = `mdl_test`\n- Model DV = `cognitive_score`\n- Model IVs = `SES` and `age`\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nmdl_test <- lm(cognitive_score ~ SES + age, data = data_name)\n```\n\nI want to change the names of `SES` and `age` to be `socio-economic status` and `age - in years` respectively. What we need to pay attention to here is the ordering of the IVs - the ordering in our `lm()` must match that in `tab_model()`. I also want to name my table *Regression Table for Cognitive Scores Model*. Here is how we would do this in **R**:\n\n```{r eval = FALSE}\nlibrary(sjPlot)\ntab_model(mdl_test,\n          pred.labels = c('Intercept', 'socio-economic status', 'age - in years'),\n          title

Referencing\n\nCross-referencing is a very helpful way to direct your reader through your document, and the good news is that this can be done automatically in RMarkdown. \n\n`r optbegin(\"Cross Referencing\", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThere are three key components to allow you to successfully cross-reference within your RMarkdown document:\n\n+ A bookdown output format\n+ A caption to your figure or table\n+ A named/labeled code chunk\n\nOnce you have the above, you will be able to cross-reference using the syntax \\@ref(type:label), where label is the chunk name/label,  and type is the environment being referenced (e.g. tab for table, fig for figure, etc.).\n\nFor an in-depth overview and example of how to cross-reference, see [Lesson 7 of the RMD bootcamp](https://uoepsy.github.io/scs/rmd-bootcamp/07-refs.html). \n\n\n`r optend()`\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-in-header":["assets/toggling.html",{"text":"<link
