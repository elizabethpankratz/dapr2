There is no new lab content for this week - the purpose of this lab is for you to revisit and revise concepts that you have learned over the last 5 weeks. 

There are no exercises for you to complete. You can use this time to finish any outstanding lab exercises, or to help guide your revision work through the flashcards below.

Before you expand each of the boxes below, think about how comfortable you feel with each concept.

`r optbegin("Probability, Odds, Log-Odds", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`


- The __probability__ $p$ ranges from 0 to 1.

- The __odds__ $\frac{p}{1-p}$ ranges from 0 to $\infty$. 
  
- The __log-odds__ $\log \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)$ ranges from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.

```

In order to understand the connections among these concepts, lets work with an example where the *probability* of an event occurring is 0.2:

+ Odds of event occurring:

$$
\text{odds} = (\frac{0.2}{0.8}) = 0.25
$$

+ Log-odds of the event occurring: 

$$
log(\frac{0.2}{0.8}) = -1.3863
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\text{OR}
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
log(0.25) = -1.3863
$$

+ Probability can be reconstructed as:

$$
(\frac{odds}{1+odds}) = (\frac{0.25}{1+0.25}) = 0.2
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\text{OR}
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
(\frac{exp(log(odds))}{1+exp(log(odds))}) = (\frac{exp(-1.3863)}{1+exp(-1.3683)}) = (\frac{0.25}{1.25}) = 0.2
$$

:::blue

In **R**:

+ obtain the odds 
  
  `odds <- 0.2 / (1 - 0.2)`

+ obtain the log-odds for a given probability
  
  `log_odds <- log(0.25)`
  
  **OR**
  
  `log_odds <- qlogis(0.2)`

+ obtain the probability from the odds
  
  `prob_O <- odds / (1 + odds)`

+ obtain the probability from the log-odds 
  
  `prob_LO <- exp(log_odds) / (1 + exp(log_odds))`
  
  **OR** 
    
  `prob_LO <- plogis(log_odds)`

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Generalized Linear Models", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Generalized linear models can be fitted in R using the `glm` function, which is similar to the `lm` function for fitting linear models. However, we also need to specify the family (i.e., link) function. There are three key components to consider:

+ Random component / probability distribution - The distribution of the response/outcome variable. Can be from any family of distributions as listed below.
+ Systematic component / linear predictor - the explanatory/predictor variable(s) (can be continuous or discrete). 
+ Link function - specifies the link between a random and systematic components.

**Formula:**  
  
$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + + \beta_2 x_i + \epsilon_i$  

:::blue
**In R:**  
  
`glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, family = [INSERT_FAMILY])`  
:::

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Family Argument", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

The family argument takes (the name of) a family function which specifies the link function and variance function (as well as a few other arguments not entirely relevant to the purpose of this course).

The exponential family functions available in **R** are:

+ `binomial` (link = "logit")
+ `gaussian` (link = "identity")
+ `poisson` (link = "log")
+ `Gamma` (link = "inverse")
+ `inverse.gaussian` (link = "1/mu2")

See `?glm` for other modeling options. See `?family` for other allowable link functions for each family.

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Binary Logistic Regression", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

When a response (y) is binary coded (e.g., 0/1; failure/success; no/yes; fail/pass; unemployed/employed) we must use logistic regression. The predictors can either be continuous or categorical. 

$$
{\log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ x_{i1} 
$$

:::blue
**In R:**  
  
`glm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data, family = binomial)`  
:::

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Interpreting Coefficients", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
To translate log-odds to odds in order to aid interpretation, you must exponentiate (i.e., by using `exp()`) the coefficients from your model.


:::blue
**In R:**  
  
`exp(coef(modelname))`  

We can also use R to extract predicted probabilities for us from our models.

+ Calculate the predicted log-odds (probabilities on the logit scale): `predict(model, type="link")`
+ Calculate the predicted probabilities: `predict(model, type="response")`

:::

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Exploratory vs Confirmatory Analyses",olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

*Exploratory* analyses are conducted when either (1) you have a hypothesis but no clear analysis plan/strategy; (2) you have lots of variables that might be associated with an outcome variable, but you're not sure which or in what ways i.e., no clear predictions. It also provides tools for hypothesis generation - particularly via visualisation of data.

*Confirmatory* analyses are conducted when you have a specific research question to test. You can think of this type of analysis as putting your hypotheses to trial - does your data support or fail to support your argument?

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Steps in Exploratory Analyses",olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
There are a number of steps involved in exploratory analyses:

+ Step 1: Check coding of data and visualise variables of interest
+ Step 2: Compare  models of interest to find if your variables of interest are good predictors of your outcome variable
+ Step 3: Compute the k-fold cross validation MSE for each of your models
+ Step 4: Identify best fitting model
